<b>Note:</b> If you had no problems with the previous assignment, then this a trivial
assignment. All you are doing is putting everything into a class. (Much like you're
doing for the lab).
<!--
 Before all of the snow, I had intended to give this out this week.
Normally, I would only give students one week to do the assignment, as it
is not difficult. However, instead of waiting until next Friday to give out the assignment
and then have it due the following week, I'm going to give it out today and give you
two weeks to complete it. There are a lot of diligent students in CS170 that don't want
to do nothing for a week so this will allow them to "get ahead" of it.
-->
<br><br>
<b>Also, you will receive feedback on the first assignment (in your returned folders soon),
so you will want to check that so you don't lose the same points twice.</b>

<b>Observations:</b> Many students are forgetting that arrays in C/C++ are zero-based, meaning, if
you have an array of 5 boats, you'd better only index that array with 0 through 4. Students are indexing that array using the
BoatID (1 through 5), which is the cause of 99.9% of the problems. Remember, <b>overwriting an array means your program is undefined (broken)</b>, which
(unfortunately) usually means it will work for you on your machine with simple tests, but won't work for me when I test it. The same is true
when doing bounds-checking to see if the boat or shot is outside of the array (ocean).
So, please, please, please pay attention to the
details when indexing an array. 
<br><br>
The sample driver is just that, a sample. Just because you pass all of the tests in that simple driver doesn't necessarily mean your code is perfect.
Several people had incorrect output or crashes because they failed to check the coordinates of the boats or shots correctly. The problem is that they
failed to check if the coordinates were negative. They were checking that the coordinates were less than the x and y dimensions, but they didn't 
check to make sure the coordinates weren't less than 0. Many students failed to do this. Double-check your checks!

GUI Driver</p>

After completing this assignment, you will have the "logic" to create a simple game like this one. 
<!-- Of course, you need to know how to create a graphical user interface, which is one of the things you'll learn in CS230. -->

<p>
<a href="WarBoats.exe">Download the executable</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No installation necessary. Just copy to your hard drive and run it.
<p>
	
<!--	
<a href="WarBoatsOO-src.zip">Object files</a> for the GUI driver. You just need to add your Ocean.cpp and
Ocean.h files and run the <b>build.bat</b> batch file to compile and link everything. You must have Borland's Turbo C++ installed. See the <tt>readme.txt</tt>
that is included in the archive.

<li><b>Question:<br>
The table in the handout says that the subtraction operator calculates the difference between two Points, 
but the driver program also shows subtraction between a Point and a double. Which is the correct one?
</b>
<p>

<b>Answer:</b><br>
Actually, they are both correct. You need to overload the subtraction operator for both cases. The first 
case is as described in the handout: the distance between two points is a double. The second case will be a 
double subtracted from a Point. The result will be a Point. The reason for this seemingly "weird" rule is 
that subtracting a positive value from a Point should be the same as adding a negative value to a Point:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>void</b> TranslateTest(<b>void</b>)
{
  Point pt1(6, 8), pt2(4, 1);

  <font color="#003399"><i>// This should result in a double</i></font>
  <b>double</b> d = pt1 - pt2;

  <font color="#003399"><i>// These two should result in the same Point</i></font>
  Point pt3 = pt1 - 2;  
  Point pt4 = pt1 + -2;

  <font color="#003399"><i>// THIS SHOULD NOT COMPILE</i></font>
  pt3 = 2 - pt1;
}
</pre></blockquote>

<li><b>Question:<br>
My code compiles and runs all of the tests with only one constructor. Why do I need two? 
</b>
<p>

<b>Answer:</b><br>
Does your code compile and run the tests that are NOT supposed to compile? If so, then you have
the wrong constructor. (Hint: You won't have any default parameters in your constructors.)

<li><b>Question:<br>
Are we allowed to create any gettor functions so the non-member, non-friend functions can access the 
private <tt><b>x_</b></tt> and <tt><b>y_</b></tt> members?
</b>
<p>

<b>Answer:</b><br>
No. You do not need any gettor functions. You are only allowed to create the functions specified. That is, 
2 constructors and 18 operators (14 member, 2 friend, and 2 non-member, non-friend.) Since all of the 
functions are trivial, you won't need any helper functions (except for the ones that are already
provided.)
If you forgot how to implement the non-member, non-friend functions without gettor functions, review the
lecture notes.

<li><b>Question:<br>
All of my output seems to be correct except for the rotation. I'm getting <tt>-0.000</tt> instead of
just <tt>0.000</tt>. What's the problem and how can I fix it?
</b>
<p>

<b>Answer:</b><br>
The problem is with the <b>double</b> data type. When using integers, there is only 0; there is no -0. 
However, with doubles (or any floating point type), you can have both +0.0 and -0.0. Usually, this 
isn't a problem, but if you round a very small negative number, you will get -0.000. For example, if 
you have the value <tt>0.00000000000664</tt> and you print it out rounded to 3 decimal places, you'll 
get <tt>0.000</tt>. But, if you have the value <tt>-0.00000000000664</tt> and you print it out rounded 
to 3 decimal places, you'll get <tt>-0.000</tt>.
<p>
To fix this, we have to check to see how small the value is, and if it is small enough, we will call it 
zero. For this assignment, we will say that any value that is between -0.00001 and +0.00001 is zero. 
This arbitrary value (0.00001) is called an <i><b>epsilon</b></i>. You'll see that there is a constant 
in the partial implementation file like this:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>const double</b> EPSILON = 0.00001;
</pre></blockquote>

You should have code similar to this in your rotation code (for both x and y):

<blockquote><pre>
  <font color="#003399"><i>// If value is between -EPSILON and +EPSILON, make it 0.0</i></font>
<b>if</b> (value &gt; -EPSILON &amp;&amp; value &lt; EPSILON)
  value = 0.0;
</pre></blockquote>

<a name="Q6">
<li><b>Question:<br>
How can we overload the pre/post increment/decrement operators when they both take no arguments?
How is the compiler going to distinguish between pre and post? For example:</b>

<blockquote><pre>
Point pt(3, 4);
++pt; <font color="#003399"><i>// This should call operator++(), e.g. pt.operator++()</i></font>
pt++; <font color="#003399"><i>// This should call operator++(), e.g. pt.operator++()</i></font>
</pre></blockquote>
</b>
</a>
<p>

<b>Answer:</b><br>
When the ++ operator comes before (pre) the operand, the compiler <i>knows</i> this is the pre-increment
operator. When the ++ operator comes after (post) the operand, the compiler <i>knows</i> this is  the
post-increment operator. Therefore, the compiler isn't confused about which one you mean.
<p>
However, neither operator requires
an argument so both functions will look identical. (Neither one can be marked <tt><b>const</b></tt>
because they both change the operand).
<p>
The solution is to pass a "dummy" argument (an integer) to
the post-increment operator (showing functional notation that the compiler uses):

<blockquote><pre>
++pt; <font color="#003399"><i>// pre-increment, compiler changes to pt.operator++()</i></font>
pt++; <font color="#003399"><i>// post-increment, compiler changes to pt.operator++(0)</i></font>
</pre></blockquote>

You as the programmer are not passing that value. When the compiler sees the pre-increment
operator, it calls the function that takes no arguments. When the compiler sees the post-increment
operator, it calls the function that takes an integer and passes a 0.
<p>
So, it is the compiler that is making the call and it will decide which to call.

BTW, it doesn't have to be 0, it just has to be <i>any</i> integer so that the compiler knows which one to call.
This means that the signatures look like this:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>operator</b>++();    <font color="#003399"><i>// pre-increment operator, no params</i></font>
<b>operator</b>++(<b>int</b>); <font color="#003399"><i>// post-increment operator, one <b>int</b> param </i></font>

</pre></blockquote>

<a name="Q7">
<li><b>Question:<br>
The sample driver shows several commented-out lines in the <i>IncDecTest</i> that should not compile. When I enable those,
my code still compiles cleanly. Why are they supposed to fail and why is my code
"failing to fail"?
</b>
</a>
<p>

<b>Short Answer:</b><br>
The answer is in the <a href="../../../../../../docs/OperatorPrecedence-CPP.html">operator precedence chart for C++</a>.
<p>

<b>Long Answer:</b><br>
What is printed out below? In other words, what is the value of <i>number</i> after the second statement?
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
<b>int</b> number = 0;
number++;        <font color="#003399"><i>// What is being incremented?</i></font>
cout &lt;&lt; number;
</pre></blockquote>

If you said <i>"1"</i>, you're correct. This is something you learned a long time ago
and even beginner programmers get that correct. OK, suppose we change the second
statement to this:

<blockquote><pre>
(number++)++;    <font color="#003399"><i>// What is being incremented?</i></font>
</pre></blockquote>

Now what is printed? If you said <i>"2"</i>, you'd be wrong and probably quite 
surprised. The answer is that the
second statement is illegal and won't compile. Realize that this is also illegal:

<blockquote><pre>
++(number++);    <font color="#003399"><i>// What is being incremented?</i></font>
</pre></blockquote>

If those statements were valid, the answer would still be 1, which would only
lead to confusion for programmers the world over. The answer lies in the question
that is in the comment:

<blockquote><pre>
<font color="#003399"><i>// What is being incremented?</i></font>
</pre></blockquote>

To answer that, you simply have to answer the question: <i>"What is returned from
the postfix increment operator?"</i>. The answer to that question is:
<i>"A temporary copy of number"</i>. A copy is being made so that this kind of
statement works as expected:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>int</b> num1 = 0;
<b>int</b> num2 = num1++; <font color="#003399"><i>// Returns the &quot;old&quot; value (a copy) of num1</i></font>
</pre></blockquote>

After the code above executes, <i>num1</i> is 1 and <i>num2</i> is 0. So, what's 
happening inside the postfix increment operation is that a temporary copy of <i>num1</i>
is made, then, <i>num1</i> is incremented to 1, and then the temporary copy is used
to assign to <i>num2</i>.
<p>
So, if either of these were allowed:

<blockquote><pre>
(number++)++;    <font color="#003399"><i>// What is being incremented?</i></font>
++(number++);    <font color="#003399"><i>// What is being incremented?</i></font>
</pre></blockquote>

The unnamed, compiler-generated, temporary copy of <i>number</i> would be incremented,
but then that incremented copy is immediately discarded because the programmer has no
access to it (it doesn't have a name). The short answer above said that the 
answer was in the 
<a href="../../../../../../docs/OperatorPrecedence-CPP.html">operator precedence chart for C++</a>.
And if you look at the postfix increment/decrement operators you will see this
(just showing the relevant operators):

<blockquote><pre>
<b> Rank   Operator            Description                  Result    Associativity</b>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  B5     ++                  Postfix increment            <b>rexp</b>         L-R
  B6     --                  Postfix decrement            <b>rexp</b>         L-R
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  C5     ++                  Prefix increment             <b>lexp</b>         R-L
  C6     --                  Prefix decrement             <b>lexp</b>         R-L
</pre></blockquote>

The key is in the <b>Result</b> column. The postfix operators return an <i>r-expression</i>
or <i>r-value</i>. That's a fancy name for <i>unnamed compiler-generated temporary</i> and
the programmer cannot access these.
<p>
To the contrary, the prefix increment/decrement operators
return an <i>l-value</i>, which represents a named memory location which the programmer
can access. That's why this is completely legal and does what you'd expect:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>int</b> number = 0;
++++number;     <font color="#003399"><i>// Same as ++(++number), parens are redundant</i></font>
cout &lt;&lt; number; <font color="#003399"><i>// Prints the value 2</i></font>
</pre></blockquote>

Even this is fine:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>int</b> number = 0;
++++++++++number;   
cout &lt;&lt; number; <font color="#003399"><i>// Prints the value 5</i></font>
</pre></blockquote>

Since the compiler implements all of the operators for the built-in types
(<i>int</i>, <i>long</i>, <i>double</i>, etc.), it enforces this rule and prevents
<i>strange and surprising</i> behavior that would confuse programmers.
However, when you, the programmer, are overloading operators for user-defined
types (such as <i>Point</i>), the compiler does not enforce this. 
(Which is why you can overload the <tt>'+'</tt> operator to do subtraction.
The compiler doesn't care.)
<p>
<p class="technote">  
To prevent the <i>strange and surprising</i> behavior when using the temporary
copy returned from the postfix operators, you need to make sure they return
constant (i.e. <tt><b>const</b></tt>) objects.
</p>

Finally, this applies to all operators that <i>return copies by value</i>, not just the postfix
increment and decrement operators.

This is one of the <i>Golden Rules</i> that Scott Meyers talks about in 
<i>Item 6</i> in his book <i>Effective C++</i> from his
<a href="https://www.aristeia.com/books.html">Effective C++ Series</a>.
Here's an excerpt:
<p>

<font color="blue">
<blockquote>
A good rule to follow when designing classes is <i>when in doubt, do as the ints do</i>,
and the ints most certainly do not allow double application of postfix increment:

<blockquote><pre>
<font color="blue"><b>int</b></font> i;
i++++; // error!
</pre></blockquote>

The second reason is that double application of postfix increment almost never does
what clients expect it to. As noted above, the second application of operator++ in
a double increment changes the value of the object returned from the first invocation,
not the value of the original object. Hence, if

<blockquote><pre>
i++++;
</pre></blockquote>

were legal, i would be incremented only once. This is counterintuitive and confusing
(for both ints and user-defined types) so it's best prohibited.

C++ prohibits it for ints, but you must prohibit it yourself for classes you write.
The easiest way to do this is to make the return type of postfix increment a const
object. Then when compilers see

<blockquote><pre>
i++++; // same as i.operator++(0).operator++(0);
</pre></blockquote>

they recognize that the const object returned from the first call to operator++
is being used to call operator++ again. operator++, however, is a non-const member function,
so const objects &mdash; such as those returned from postfix operator++ &mdash; can't call it.
If you've ever wondered if it makes sense to have functions return const objects,
now you know: sometimes it does, and postfix increment and decrement are examples.
</blockquote>
</font>

There is even a g++ option named after his books, <i>-Weffc++</i>, which
enforces a lot of his advice.

<b>Answer:</b><br>
You are calling the functions incorrectly. All C/C++ library functions are in the <b><tt>std</tt></b>

Microsoft and GNU allow it without the namespace, which is non-standard.

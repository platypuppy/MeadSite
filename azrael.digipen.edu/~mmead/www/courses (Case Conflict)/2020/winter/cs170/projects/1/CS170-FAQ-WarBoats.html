Question:<br>
Can I modify the <tt>Ocean.h</tt> file and add more members?
</b>
<p>

<b>Answer:</b><br>
No. Everything you need for this assignment is already there. Of course, there are many ways that
you could implement this assignment, but I want everyone to work with the same structures. The only
file that you are to modify is <a href="Ocean.cpp.html"><tt>Ocean.cpp</tt></a> that I gave you. There's a comment in that file
that shows you exactly where all of your code belongs. You should probably only need to write five
functions in the file (one for each of the functions listed in <a href="WarBoats.h.html"><tt>WarBoats.h</tt></a>).
Of course, you may want to have some helper functions to cut down on the size of the non-trivial functions.
(e.g. <i>PlaceBoat</i> and <i>TakeShot</i>).

<b>
Question:<br>
What, exactly, are the numbers in the Ocean supposed to represent?</i>
</b>
<p>

<b>Answer:</b><br>
The numbers depend on what's in the Ocean (array of integers) at that index.
<p>
<ol>
  <li>When the Ocean (array) is first allocated, you set every element to <i>dtOK</i>, 
    which is the integer value 0 defined in <a href="WarBoats.h.html">WarBoats.h</a>. This is an empty Ocean.</li>
  <li>When you place a boat in the Ocean, you use its ID number. Each boat has an ID from 1 to
99. (The maximum number of boats you can place is 99.) All boats are the same length,
<i>BOAT_LENGTH</i>, which is defined as 4 in <a href="Ocean.cpp.html">Ocean.cpp</a>.

This means that boat #1 will have four 1s
in the array, boat #2 will have four 2s in the array, etc.
See the diagram (on the left) in the 
<a href="cs170-programming-assignment-warboats.pdf">handout</a> 
which shows 3 boats placed into the Ocean.</li>
<li>When a shot is taken that lands inside the Ocean you will change the value at that index
  to reflect what is there:
  <ul>
    <li>If you hit a boat, meaning that the value at that index is between 1 and 99, you will
      simply add <i>HIT_OFFSET</i> (defined as 100 in <a href="Ocean.cpp.html">Ocean.cpp</a>) to the value.
      This means that if a part of boat #3 was hit, the 3 will be changed to
      the value 103. This allows you to easily see what the status of each boat is. If the value
      is between 1 and 99, then that part of the boat has NOT been hit. If the value is
      between 101 and 199, it means that that part of the boat has been hit.</li>
    <li>If you miss all of the boats (and hit the empty waters), you will change the <i>dtOK</i> to
      <i>dtBLOWNUP</i>, which is defined as the integer value -1.</li>
    <li>If you hit the same part of the boat multiple times (duplicate), you just keep the value
      that is currently there, which is <i>HIT_OFFSET</i> plus the boat's ID.</li>
    <li>Likewise, if you hit a part of the Ocean that was already hit (duplicate), you keep
      the value <i>dtBLOWNUP</i> there, as well.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
<p>
To recap, these are the valid values in the Ocean array:
<ol>
  <li><i>dtOK</i> - (The integer 0) means this is an un-hit portion of the Ocean.</li>
  <li><i>dtBLOWNUP</i> - (The integer -1) means this part of the Ocean has been hit.</li>
  <li>A value between 1 and 99 means that this part of a boat (ID 1 to 99) has NOT been hit yet.</li>
  <li>A value between 101 and 199 means that this part of a boat has been hit. To figure out
    which boat has been hit, you simply subtract <i>HIT_OFFSET</i> from the value.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Finally, make sure that you are using the enumerations and constants and NOT hard-coding their
values, such as 0 or -1.

<b>
Question:<br>
What do we do if the client asks us to create an ocean with five boats, and then calls <i>PlaceBoat</i>
more than five times?
</b>
<p>

<b>Answer:</b><br>
You don't have to worry about things like that. At this stage of the program, there are many things that
the client can do that will cause bad things to happen. We will see later on how we can prevent many
of those behaviors. For now, don't try to account for everything that could go wrong. If the client
says there will be five boats, you can assume that's how many you'll get. Also, if the client specifies
that there will be 5 boats, you will get the boat IDs 
from 1 to 5, which makes them easy to use as indexes into the Boats array. 

<p>
<b>Don't forget, though, that the arrays are zero-based, so you'll have to use <tt>ID - 1</tt> as the index.</b>

<b>
Question:<br>
The function <i>CreateBoat</i> is supposed to return a pointer. Isn't that going to be unsafe? Returning
a pointer from a function means that the pointer is no longer defined.
</b>
<p>

<b>Answer:</b><br>
It's safe to return a pointer, as long as the pointer is pointing at something that will still exist when
the function returns. The handout says that an ocean will be created <i>dynamically</i> and a pointer to it
will be returned. This means that you will use <tt><b>new</b></tt> to dynamically allocate the memory
for the ocean. The partial code will look something like this:

<blockquote><pre>
Ocean *CreateOcean(int num_boats, int x_quadrants, int y_quadrants)
{
    // Create an ocean dynamically
  Ocean *ocean = new Ocean;

    // Create the array for the boats dynamically (use [] with new for arrays)
  ocean->boats = new Boat[num_boats];

    // Create the 2D array for the grid
  ocean->grid = new int[x_quadrants * y_quadrants];

    /*
       Here, you must initialize all of the fields of the
       structs being used (Ocean, Stats, Boats, grid, etc.)

    */

    // Return a pointer to the ocean
  return ocean;
}
</pre></blockquote>


Don't forget that everything that you allocated with <tt><b>new</b></tt> must be de-allocated
with <tt><b>delete</b></tt> and everything that is allocated with <tt><b>new[]</b></tt> must
be de-allocated with <tt><b>delete[]</b></tt>. This will be done in <i>DestroyOcean</i>.

<!--
(Don't forget the difference
between <tt><b>delete</b></tt> and <tt><b>delete[]</b></tt>.)

<b>
Question:<br>
If the <b>Ocean</b> is supposed to represent a 2-dimensional array, why is <tt>Ocean.grid</tt> a pointer to the
first element of a single-dimensional array?
</b>
<p>
<b>Answer:</b><br>
Long story short: It's easier. (This is because it's a <i>dynamic</i> array, not a static one, so you
have no way of determining how many rows/columns there will be when you declare the <tt>Ocean.grid</tt>
variable). Treating a 2D array as a 1D array is trivial. You just have to do the math (read: pointer arithmetic) 
yourself. 
<p>
<b>Example (from CS120):</b><br>
Compare a static 2D array called <tt>points</tt> with a dynamic 1D array. There are 3 rows and 4 columns. The address
of each cell is displayed to the left and the subscript for that cell is displayed to the right.
<p>

<table border=0 cellspacing=5>
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<blockquote><pre>
<b>double</b> points[3][4];


<p>
<br>
<img src="PointsArray-2.gif">
</pre></blockquote>
</td>
<td>
</td>
<td valign="top">
<blockquote><pre>
<b>double</b> *pd = <b>new</b> double[3 * 4];
<p>
<font size=0>&nbsp;</font>
<img src="PointsArrayDynamic-1.gif">
</pre></blockquote>
</td>
</tr></table>

Given a row and column:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>int</b> row = 1, column = 2;
<b>double</b> value;
</pre></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>The static 2D array can be accessed using two subscripts, but the dynamic "2D array" can 
only be indexed with a single subscript.
<blockquote><pre>
value = points[row][column]; <font color="#003399"><i>/* OK      */</i></font>
value = pd[row][column];     <font color="#003399"><i>/* ILLEGAL */</i></font>
</pre></blockquote>

<li>We (the programmers) have to do all of the arithmetic to locate an element using two subscripts:
<blockquote><pre>
value = pd[row * 4 + column];
</pre></blockquote>

<li>The compiler is still doing some of the work for us:

<blockquote><pre>
value = *(address-of-pd + (row * 4 + column) * sizeof(double));
</pre></blockquote>

<li> The general form to access a cell in a 2D array (represented as a 1D array) 
  where ROW is the row, COLUMN is the column,	WIDTH is 
	the number of columns, and ARRAY is the name of the array is:
	
<blockquote><pre>
ARRAY[ ROW * WIDTH + COLUMN ]
</pre></blockquote>
	
So, to access row 2, column 1 in the example above:

<blockquote><pre>
pd[ 2 * 4 + 1 ] = pd[ 9 ]
</pre></blockquote>

which coincides with the diagram that shows <tt>point[2][1]</tt> (address 172) is the same as <tt>pd[9]</tt> (address 172).
Sorry, but there's no magic here.
<p>
You may find it convenient to create helper function that
converts a 2D index into a 1D index and vice-versa.

<p>
<li>Refer to <a href="https://azrael.digipen.edu/~mmead/www/courses/CS120/Arrays-2D.html">2D arrays</a> from your CS120 notes 
  for more information.

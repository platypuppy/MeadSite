<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321623215">The C++ Standard Library: A Tutorial and Reference (2nd Edition)</a>:

The C++ standard library provides a set of common classes and interfaces that greatly 
extend the core C++ language. The library, however, is not self-explanatory. To make
full use of its components–and to benefit from their power–you need a resource that
does far more than list the classes and their functions.
<p>
<i>The C++ Standard Library: A Tutorial and Reference, Second Edition</i>, describes
this library as now incorporated into the new ANSI/ISO C++ language standard (C++11).
The book provides comprehensive documentation of each library component, including
an introduction to its purpose and design; clearly written explanations of complex
concepts; the practical programming details needed for effective use; traps and
pitfalls; the exact signature and definition of the most important classes and
functions; and numerous examples of working code.
The book focuses in particular
on the Standard Template Library (STL), examining
<font color="blue"><b>containers, iterators, function objects, and STL algorithms.</b></font>

Required Software (free)
</p>
All of the software that is required for this course is installed on all of the computers at Digipen.
However, for those of you that wish to also work on your own computers (recommended), these are the
things you will need to install and configure on your own computer.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Windows 32-bit/64-bit C++ compiler (MinGW)</b> This is the compiler that we will be using for all of the
	work in CS170. There are detailed instructions on downloading, installing, and configuring
	the software <a href="../../../../public/mingw/index.html">here</a>.
	<p>
		<blockquote>
	<font color="blue">
	This is the same compiler that you installed for CS120, so if you installed it for CS120, you
	don't have to do anything.</font>
	</blockquote>
	<!--Note that this will also install a C++ compiler, which you will need next semester in CS170.-->
<p>


<li><b>Cygwin Utilities</b> - Download the <a href="https://azrael.digipen.edu/~mmead/www/public/Files/preinstalls/cygwin64-2016-preinstalled.zip">Cygwin64 programs</a> 
and put them on your computer. There's a document 
<a class="pdf-icon" href="../../../../public/Files/preinstalls/readme-2017-cygwin-install.pdf">readme-2017-cygwin-install.pdf</a>
that explains what to do. This is also the same set that you installed for CS120.
<p class="technote">
The zip file contains many command-line utilities that you will use throughout your time at Digipen.
The zip file is about 530 MB and extracts to about 1.5 GB.
Creates a folder named <tt>cygwin64</tt> on the C: drive.
</p>
<!--
 There is also a PDF there that explains what to do: 
<a href="http://azrael.digipen.edu/~mmead/www/public/Files/preinstalls/readme-2014-RTIS-image.pdf">readme-2014-RTIS-image.pdf</a>.
<p class="technote">
Note that you only need the Cygwin64 files. You don't need any of the other files (e.g. Clang, MinGW, etc.) that are posted on
that site. You're welcome to download them and try them, but I won't give you any support on those. You will need 
some of those programs in CS170 next semester.
-->
</li>
Don't forget to add <tt>C:\cygwin64\bin</tt> directory to your PATH. 
	<a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/renso/archive/2009/10/21/how-to-set-the-windows-path-in-windows-7.aspx">
	Windows 7</a>.
	 If you're new to computers or Windows, there's a nicer GUI (Graphical User Interface) program
	called <a href="http://eveditor.com">Windows Environment Variables Editor</a> that makes it easier to
	manipulate the PATH.</li>

<ul>
	<li>Understanding the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)">PATH variable</a> from wikipedia.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access/">
		Editing the PATH variable</a> on Windows 7, 8, and 10.</li>
	<li>Once you've got Cygwin installed and in your PATH, you can type this to see a better view of
		your PATH from the command line:
<blockquote><pre>path | tr ; "\n"</pre></blockquote>
		This will list all of the directories in the PATH with each on a separate line. That is:
<blockquote>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 border=1>
<tr><th>Token</th><th>Meaning</th><tr>
<tr><td align="center"><tt>path</tt></td><td>Displays the PATH as one long line</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"><tt>|</tt></td><td>A vertical bar (pipe symbol), usually on the key with the backslash (\)</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"><tt>tr</tt></td><td>The translate command</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"><tt>;</tt></td><td>A semi-colon (usually to the right of the letter 'L' on the keyboard). On Linux and 
Mac OS X, use a colon instead.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"><tt>"\n"</tt></td><td>A double quote, backslash, lowercase letter 'N', double quote</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

</ul>
<li><b>C++ compiler for non-Windows users:</b>
<p class="technote">
Version 8.1.0 is what is installed with MinGW on the computers at Digipen.
For non-Windows users, if you can't get version 8.1.0,  
any 8.x.x version will probably be fine. We won't be using any of the advanced features of 
C/C++ that are in 8.x, but you do want to have the closest version possible so that you will 
get the same errors and warnings that 8.1 emits. 
<br><br>
For Mac people, you may have to install it (using <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a>)
 as the default compiler for C and C++ on Mac is Clang. If you are new to software development,
 you may need to seek help from other Mac users. (I'm not a Mac user, although I pretend sometimes!)
<!--
For Mac people, you can follow this link to 
<a href="../../../../mg/compiling-gcc7/index.html">building GCC 7.1 on macOS</a>.
I've only tested this with macOS 10.11 (El Capitan). You can also use this link to install
on Linux, but it is easier to use the link below.
-->

<br><br>
For Linux people, I recommend Linux Mint. The latest version comes with version 7.x, but
it can easily be upgraded. 
Here's some information on 
<a href="../../../../mg/update-compilers/index.html#UPDATE2">installing multiple versions</a>.
<!--
-->

 However, any distribution that allows you
to use version 8.x of the compiler should work.
<!--
<br><br>
Note that these installations will also install a C++ compiler, which you will need next semester in CS170.
-->
</p>

<!--
<li>Microsoft C++ compiler <font color="red">(Not used for grading purposes)</font>
	<p>
	If you'd like to use Microsoft's compiler to help you debug, you are free to do so.
	I am not going to specify which version of the compiler to use, nor am I going to explain
	how to use Visual Studio (or anything related to Windows). You should at least use a recent
	version, such as VS 2015 or VS 2017.
	Using this compiler is strictly for your own benefit as I won't be compiling anything with
	Microsoft's compiler.
-->
	<!--
	You can pretty much use any recent version of this compiler (Visual Studio 2015 and later). 
	I'm not sure which compiler is the default at Digipen. 
	you must first type <tt><b>setvc14</b></tt> to enable the command line tools for this version. 
	If you want the 32-bit compiler, you need to type <tt><b>setvc14-32</b></tt>.
	You need to do 	this everytime that you open a command window. As long as you don't close the window, 
	the command line tools will be enabled. <b>This compiler is only necessary for you to use the
	memory debugger</b> (<a href="http://www.drmemory.org/">Dr. Memory</a>) <b>on Windows.</b>
	<p>
	If you are having problems configuring your personal computer to use Microsoft's compiler from the 
	command line look <a href="../../../../docs/CommandLineConfigs.html">at this page</a>. It's for previous
			versions of VS, but it should get you started. You can Google for more information or visit the
			Academic Support Center for more help. If you installed VS to the default directory on the C:
			drive, you can grab the batch file named <tt><b>setvc14-32.bat</b></tt> and 
			<tt><b>setvc14-64.bat</b></tt> from one of the computers in Edison. The file are in the
			C:\utils directory (along with a bunch of others). These batch files will enable their
			respective compiler environments when working on the command line. You need to put them in
			a directory that is in your PATH.

<li><a href="http://www.drmemory.org/">Dr. Memory</a> A tool to catch memory leaks and other memory-related bugs.

Homework Assignments
</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you know how to compile projects from the command line with the compilers
	listed above. These compilers are installed on the machines at Digipen. They are also free 
	to download, so if you want to install them on your own computers, you can.	
	<p>
	Please remember that 
	all programs <b>absolutely, positively, MUST compile cleanly</b> with <tt><b>g++</b></tt>.

	If the <tt><b>g++</b></tt> compiler gives a warning or error, you'll get an automatic 0 on the assignment.
	(Note, however, that since we're using a submission server that will compile and link your code,
	you won't be able to submit anything with warnings or errors.)
<p>
Sample command lines for compiling/linking source file <tt><b>source.cpp</b></tt> into <tt><b>hw1.exe</b></tt>:
	
	<blockquote>
		GNU g++: 
<blockquote><pre>
  <big><b>g++</b> -o hw1 source.cpp -Wall -Werror -Wextra -ansi -pedantic -O</big>  
</pre></blockquote>
</blockquote>


<!--
	<blockquote>
		Microsoft:
<blockquote><pre>
  <big><b>cl</b> /W4 /EHa /Za /Fehw1.exe /D_CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE source.cpp</big>
</pre></blockquote>
</blockquote>


	<blockquote>
		Clang++: 
<blockquote><pre>
  <big><b>clang++</b> -o hw1 source.cpp -Wall -Werror -Wextra -ansi -pedantic -O2</big>  
</pre></blockquote>
If you're working on Windows and Clang fails to link, add the <tt><b>-c</b></tt> option to compile only:
<blockquote><pre>
  <big>clang++ <b>-c</b> -o hw1 source.cpp -Wall -Werror -Wextra -ansi -pedantic -O2</big>  
</pre></blockquote>

	Try to create a very simple makefile and test it. Advanced students can read more, if you're inclined.
	<p>
	Also, take any two of your CS120 assignments/labs (e.g. spellcheck/dumpit) and create a makefile for it. 
	This will show you if you understand the presentation I gave on using <tt><b>make</b></tt> and will
	prepare you for future labs. 
	<p>
	Read these sections from the <a href="http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/index.html">Doxygen help</a>

	<a href="http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/starting.html">Documenting the code</a>, and 
	<a href="http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/lists.html">Lists</a>. You
	should also skim these sections (for reference and information): 
	<a href="http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/config.html">Configuration</a> and 
	<a href="http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html">Special Commands</a>.
<p>
	Take an assignment/lab (e.g. spellcheck) and convert the CS120-style comments
	(file header comment and function header comments) to Doxygen-style comments
	and run Doxygen on it.
	Here is a <a href="Doxyfile-1.8.15.txt">Doxygen template</a> for you to start with.
	Rename it to just Doxyfile.

	<br>Browse through these two chapters to get an idea of what Doxygen can do: 
	Configuration and Special Commands
<br>
	Also, take one of your CS120 assignments (e.g. spellcheck) and Doxygenize it. This will show you if
	you understand how to use Doxygen before being required to submit code that uses it.
	This should only take a few minutes since you should already have comments for everything. You just
	need to insert the proper Doxygen tags.

	If you think that the CS 120 Style Guide is something arbitrary and antiquated that Mead invented,

	This will help you look good to a potential employer in an interview (or at least you won't 
	embarrass me!) Some of the topics we haven't talked about yet, but most of it should sound familiar
	to you. Note: We are not following this guide. It's just meant as an example of what a real company

Write What You Know, and Know What You Write</a> Advice From the C++ Experts:
My best advice? Don't get fancy. Treat a new C++ feature like you would treat a loaded automatic weapon in a crowded room: never use it just 
because it looks nifty. Wait until you understand the consequences, don't get cute, write what you know, and know what you write. The article is a little out-dated, but most of the advice is still excellent, 
especially for new programmers that like to use language features that they don't really understand yet.

Think that DigiPen is asking too much in the programming courses? It could be worse.

modern features like a backspace key to correct it. You threw away the card and started over."

While many simple programs fit into a single C or CPP source file, any serious project is going to need splitting up into several source files 
in order to be manageable. However, many beginning programmers may not realize what the point of this is - especially since some may have tried it 
themselves and run into so many problems that they decided it wasn't worth the effort.

Memory bugs, essentially a mistake in the management of heap memory, are caused by a

bugs can be introduced at any time is part of what makes memory debugging a challenging task.

In a well-designed system, simple things should be simple, and the "obvious easy" way to do simple 
common tasks should be the correct way. I call this goal "no sharp edges" - to use an analogy, if 
you're designing a wrench, don't put razor blades on the handles.

Either people love Microsoft, or they hate them, and that's about how most people feel about one of "the Empire's" former 
influential evangelists, Alex St John. Credited with successes such as initiating the development of the Direct X API in order to 
move gaming from DOS to Windows, throwing wild parties for game developers, and working hard to get himself fired.

This is a slashdot article (so you have to be prepared for a certain kind of "conversation"), but it references a real article that
has been a topic of much debate in recent years.

	I've often thought that software developers were akin to Magpies: birds who are notorious for stealing shiny items to decorate their complex 
	nests. Like Magpies, software developers are unusually smart and curious creatures, almost by definition. But <b>we are too easily distracted by shiny new toys and playthings</b>.

<li><a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/printerfriendly.aspx?p=686170">C Language Issues for Application Security</a>
	This chapter explores subtle details of the C programming language that could adversely affect an application's security and robustness. 
	Specifically, it covers the storage details of primitive types, arithmetic overflow and underflow conditions, type conversion issues, 
	such as the default type promotions, signed/unsigned conversions and comparisons, sign extension, and truncation. You also look at some 
	interesting nuances of C involving unexpected results from certain operators and other commonly unappreciated behaviors.

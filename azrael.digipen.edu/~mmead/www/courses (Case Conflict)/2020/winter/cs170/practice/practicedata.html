<h1>CS 170 - Practice Assignments</h1>
<br>
</center>

<p class="technote">
The purpose of these practices is to, well, practice your programming skills. Some of them are fairly easy,
and others can be a little challenging. You are not required to do any of these, but it is highly
recommended as an additional way to improve your programming skills.
<br><br>
<b>Reminder</b>: If
you want to be recommended as a TA in a future semester, do yourself a favor and do these. I'm always
asked by other instructors to recommend students for TA positions. Of course, I will look at your grade
in the course, but I will also choose TAs based on how many practices they've done. The more practices
you do, the more likely you will be selected for a TA position, either by myself, or another instructor.
<br><br>
<b>Important:</b> Since all 6 of my TAs are graduating this semester, I will be looking to replace
all of them next September.

<b>IMPORTANT:</b>
<ol>
	<li>DO NOT USE INTERNET EXPLORER IN THIS CLASS. (Unless instructed to do so. Even then, 
		question it!)</li>
	<p>
	<li>When downloading files, DO NOT save the web page, save the file.
		To save the file with Firefox, right-click on the link and choose "Save Link As..."
		This is so that all of the formatting in the file is preserved.</li>
	<p>
	<li>Don't forget that you may need to use the <b><tt>--strip-trailing-cr</tt></b> 
		switch with <tt>diff</tt>
		if it's telling you that all of the lines are different.</li>
	<p>

	All code for the labs <b>MUST</b> follow the 
	<a href="../../../../../docs/CS120StyleGuide.pdf">Style Guide for CS120</a>. The
	<b>tablen</b> program must be run on your files, as well.

<li>In order to help automate the testing of your code, the submission server will use input/output
redirection. If you understand this simple concept, it will help you automate your own testing.
<p>
Normally, output (e.g. <tt><b>std::cout</b></tt>) sends its output to the screen. To send it
to a file instead, use the greater-than (&gt;) symbol:

<blockquote><pre>
myprogram &gt; out.txt
</blockquote>

Any output from <i>myprogram</i> will go to a file named <i>out.txt</i> and you will see nothing on
the screen. 
<p>
Normally, input (e.g. <tt><b>std::cin</b></tt>) is read from the keyboard. To have the program read input
from a file instead, use the less-than (&lt;) symbol:

<blockquote><pre>
myprogram &lt; in.txt
</blockquote>

All input to <i>myprogram</i> is read from <i>in.txt</i>, and the keyboard is ignored. Also, none of the 
characters that are in the file will show on the screen.
<p>
You can redirect both input and output at the same time like this:
<blockquote><pre>
myprogram &lt; in.txt &gt; out.txt
</blockquote>

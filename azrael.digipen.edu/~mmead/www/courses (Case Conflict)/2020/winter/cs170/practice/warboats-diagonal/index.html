<p class="technote">
This practice assignment extends the previous practice assignment that allows for boats of variable sizes. You
must use that as the starting point for this practice.
</p>


<ol>
<li>This practice assignment is a modification of the WarBoatsOO (Object-oriented WarBoats)
	assignment. In the original WarBoats program, all of the boats were placed either vertically
  or horizontally in the ocean. In this version, the boats can be place diagonally, as well.
  A diagonal placement has two directions: right and left:
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>Right - The boat goes from top left to bottom right.</li>
    <li>Left - The boat goes from top right to bottom left.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  In the diagram below, boat #1 is diagonal-right and boat #2 is diagonal-left:

<blockquote><pre>
   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0
   <b>1</b>   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0
   0   <b>1</b>   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0
   0   0   <b>1</b>   0   0   0   0   0   0   0
   0   0   0   <b>1</b>   0   0   0   0   0   0
   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0
   0   0   0   0   0   <b>2</b>   0   0   0   0
   0   0   0   0   <b>2</b>   0   0   0   0   0
   0   0   0   <b>2</b>   0   0   0   0   0   0
   0   0   <b>2</b>   0   0   0   0   0   0   0
</pre></blockquote>

	<p>
	In order to support placing boats diagonally, you must update the enumeration in <tt>WarBoats.h</tt> as such:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>enum</b> Orientation { oHORIZONTAL, oVERTICAL<font color="blue"><b>, oDIAGONAL_RIGHT, oDIAGONAL_LEFT</b></font> };  
</pre></blockquote>

See the sample driver for examples.
<p>
At first glance, it seems pretty straight-forward to support diagonally-placed boats. However, if you look
closely at the outputs below, you will see a situation that isn't as easy as it first seemed:

In the first diagram on the left above, boat #2 is clearly occupying a cell that boat #1 is occupying. This
cell is marked with an <b>X</b>. The current method of detecting intersecting boats will handle this
case.
<p>
The "intersection" in the right diagram won't be detected because the two boats are not
sharing a common point. However, it is undesirable to allow that boat placement. Clearly,
a different technique is required. There are many ways to detect this intersection, but one that
you may want to use is the technique you have learned in CS 230. That is, detecting whether
two line segments intersect.

<blockquote>
<p class="technote">
If you haven't had CS230 or you want to use a different technique, you should just use
Google to find more information such as 
<a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/149622/finding-out-whether-two-line-segments-intersect-each-other">
  this</a>.

It goes without saying, but I'm going to say it anyway,
<i>"To help solve this you should have several helper functions."</i> If you try to
calculate everything in your existing <i>PlaceBoat</i> method, you will fail miserably, or
at the very least you'll have unreadable and unmaintainable code that wouldn't get any
points if this were a real assignment.

<p>
For each boat, you are given it's location in the Ocean. You are also given it's length
and it's orientation. This is enough information to transform a boat into a line segment
(two end-points) and then compare that line segment with other boats (line segments) to
see if there is an intersection. You should call this helper function from your <i>PlaceBoat</i>
method.

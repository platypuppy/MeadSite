For this week's lab, you will be adding a few simple methods. Since you've already implemented 
all of the "hard" stuff, these new functions shouldn't be too difficult and most students
will finish within 
a couple of hours.

<ol>
<li>This lab adds 4 new methods and slightly modifies 4 others. The 4 new methods are:


<blockquote><pre>
  <font color="#003399"><i>// Swaps the contents of <b>other</b> with this Vector (Constant time)</i></font>
<b>void</b> swapv(Vector &amp;other);

  <font color="#003399"><i>// Reverses the order of the elements (Linear time)</i></font>
<b>void</b> reverse();

  <font color="#003399"><i>// Equality operator (Linear time)</i></font>
  <font color="#003399"><i>// Both vectors must be the same size.</i></font>
<b>bool</b> <b>operator</b>==(<b>const</b> Vector&amp; rhs) <b>const</b>;

  <font color="#003399"><i>// Reallocates an array to match the size of the number </i></font>
  <font color="#003399"><i>// of elements. If size == capacity, does nothing. </i></font>
<b>void</b> shrink_to_fit();
</pre></blockquote>

and the 4 modified methods are the two subscript operators, the <tt><b>insert</b></tt> method, 
and the private <tt><b>check_bounds</b></tt> method. These methods will now throw an exception 
via the <tt><b>check_bounds</b></tt> method. The exception class is already given to you in the header file
on this page.

<blockquote><pre>
  <font color="#003399"><i>// Subscript operators. If the index is invalid, throws a SubscriptError.</i></font>
<b>int</b> <b>operator</b>[](<b>unsigned</b> index) <b>const</b>;
<b>int</b>&amp; <b>operator</b>[](<b>unsigned</b> index);

  <font color="#003399"><i>// Inserts a new element at the specified position. Throws a</i></font>
  <font color="#003399"><i>// SubscriptError if the position is invalid.</i></font>
<b>void</b> insert(<b>int</b> value, <b>unsigned</b> position);

  <font color="#003399"><i>// If the index is out of bounds, throw a SubscriptError.</i></font>
<b>void</b> check_bounds(<b>unsigned</b> index) <b>const</b>;

</pre></blockquote>
<p>

<blockquote>
<p class="technote">
Technically, the first 3 methods above should not have to be modified. That is, if you followed
my advice (<i>always</i> a good thing) and put your bounds-checking in the <tt>check_bounds</tt>
method and called it from the 3 methods. That way, only <tt>check_bounds</tt> will need to be
modified. Code reuse is a Wonderful Thing<big><sup>&trade;</sup></big>.

Given this header file <a  href="https://azrael.digipen.edu/~mmead/www/courses/2020/winter/cs170/labs/week11/Vector.h">Vector.h</a> (<a href="https://azrael.digipen.edu/~mmead/www/courses/2020/winter/cs170/labs/week11/Vector.h.html">HTML</a>), 
complete the implementation of the Vector class in Vector.cpp. Use the .cpp file
  from the previous lab as your starting point.
<p>

Other hints:
<ol>
<li>You should work on the new functions in the order listed above. They are listed in order from 
  very easy to less easy. The number to the left in parentheses is approximately how many lines of 
  code each function requires.
  <p>
  <ol>
  <li><font color="blue">(5)</font> <tt>swapv</tt>
  <li><font color="blue">(6)</font> <tt>reverse</tt>
  <li><font color="blue">(6)</font> <tt>operator==</tt>
  <li><font color="blue">(10)</font> <tt>shrink_to_fit</tt>
</ol>

<p>
<li>The <tt><b>swapv</b></tt> method's comment says that it should swap the two vectors in 
  constant time. How is that possible? The vectors might contain millions of elements!
  Well, it's not going to swap each element of the internal array. It
  only swaps the four private data members, which makes it very fast and efficient.
  (It also <i>guarantees</i> that no exceptions can be thrown during the swap.)
  <p>
  You should implement a <tt><b>swap</b></tt> helper method to help your <tt><b>swapv</b></tt> method. 
  This will make your <tt><b>swapv</b></tt> method trivial to implement. 
  You don't need to declare it or put it	in the class. You can 
  just put this in your .cpp file at the top (inside the CS170 namespace). DO NOT MAKE IT GLOBAL!
<blockquote><pre>
<b>template</b> &lt;<b>typename</b> T&gt;
void swap(T &a, T& b)
{
  T temp = a;
  a = b;
  b = temp;
}
</pre></blockquote>
	
<p>
<li>You've written the <tt><b>reverse</b></tt> method in CS120, so that is also trivial.
  (Even if you didn't write it in CS120, it's still trivial to do. Hint: Use the <tt><b>swap</b></tt>
  function you wrote above to help.)
<p>
<li>If you've implemented your <tt><b>insert</b></tt> method and subscript operators properly, 
  then the only code that will change is the private <tt><b>check_bounds</b></tt> method. You 
  will remove the error messages and <tt>abort()</tt> code and replace it with a single line of code 
  that will throw the 
  <tt><b>SubscriptError</b></tt> exception. 
  <p>
  In a nutshell, that is why we factored out the 
  bounds checking. Had you simply done bounds checking in each method that needed it, you would 
  have to update a lot more code. Keep this in mind when you start writing larger programs with 
  error checking. This means that the only place in your code where you'll have the <tt><b>throw</b></tt>
  keyword is in your <tt><b>check_bounds</b></tt> function. You will not <tt><b>catch</b></tt> anything.
  Remember, it is the <i>client</i> code (i.e. driver) that will <tt><b>catch</b></tt> the 
  exception.
<p>
<li>You can not change the public interface for any class that is provided to you. For the
  the <tt><b>SubscriptError</b></tt> class, you cannot change anything, public or private.
</ol>

<p>
<hr width="100%">
<p>

<li>Add Doxygen file headers and comments to <tt><b>Vector.h</b></tt> and <tt><b>Vector.cpp</b></tt>. 
  Make a bullet list of the functions in the .cpp file. 	Create doxygen function header comments 
  for each function. Most of this work was done in the previous labs, so this should only take a 
  few minutes to update.

<p>
<hr width="100%">
<p>

<li>Here are sample command lines:

GNU g++:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>g++</b> -o gnu -O2 -Wconversion -Wall -Wextra -Werror -ansi -pedantic driver.cpp Vector.cpp
</pre></blockquote>
<!--<b>clang++</b> -o clan -O2 -Wconversion -Wall -Wextra -Werror -ansi -pedantic driver.cpp Vector.cpp<br>-->

<!--
Microsoft (Optional for use with Dr. Memory)
<blockquote><pre>
<b>cl</b> /W4 /WX /Zi /MT /EHsc /Oy- /Ob0 /Fems.exe driver.cpp Vector.cpp
</pre></blockquote>
-->

<!--<b>clang++</b> -o clan -O2 -Wconversion -Wall -Wextra -Werror -ansi -pedantic driver.cpp Vector.cpp<br>-->



This is a sample driver for the new and modified methods: <a href="https://azrael.digipen.edu/~mmead/www/courses/2020/winter/cs170/labs/week11/driver.cpp">driver.cpp</a> (<a href="https://azrael.digipen.edu/~mmead/www/courses/2020/winter/cs170/labs/week11/driver.cpp.html">HTML</a>) 
and the <a href="https://azrael.digipen.edu/~mmead/www/courses/2020/winter/cs170/labs/week11/output.txt">output.txt</a>
<p>

Don't forget that you <i>may</i> need to add <tt>--strip-trailing-cr</tt> to the <tt>diff</tt> program to 
ignore the newlines.

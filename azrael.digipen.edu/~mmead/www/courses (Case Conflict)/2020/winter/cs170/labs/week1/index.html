<p class="SectionHeader">
Information
</p>
Here are some makefiles that I demonstrated during the lecture for you <b>to study and 
experiment with</b>. There is nothing to submit for this practice. However, remember:

<blockquote>
<p class="technote">
There are two types of students. <i>Which one do you want to be?</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Don't forget that the first character on the indented action/recipe lines <b>MUST</b> be the tab character.
This is one situation where you do not want to replace tabs with spaces. If you do, the makefile will
not work.
<p>
To work with these makefiles, save them from the links below. 
<b>DO NOT</b> copy and paste the code from this page. Why? Because you may not get the tab characters 
when you do that. Also, the makefile files have a <tt>.txt</tt> extension so that they can be more 
easily viewed in a browser. You should remove that file extension.
<p>
You will need your <tt>bytes</tt>, <tt>scantext</tt>, and <tt>spellcheck</tt> source and header files 
from CS120. Here is a <a href="https://azrael.digipen.edu/~mmead/www/courses/2020/winter/cs170/labs/week1/main.c">main.c</a> to use.
<p>

<p class="technote">
<b>Note 1:</b> If you don't have any of those projects you can just subsitute another project. Ideally, you will
have at least one .c file and one .h file for the project. For example, if you don't have a <i>spellcheck</i>
project but you have a <i>foobar</i> project, just replace the word <i>spellcheck</i> with the word <i>foobar</i> in
the makefile. You'll have to modify the driver (<tt>main.c</tt>) to call one of your functions.
</p>

<p class="technote">
<b>Note 2:</b> The <i>scantext</i> assignment did not have a header file. The functions were simply prototyped in the driver.
You will need to create a header file yourself. Simply prototype the 4 functions in a file named
<tt>scantext.h</tt> and you should be good to go.
</p>

Make sure that you create the <tt><b>gcc</b></tt> directory <i>before</i> you run
make, as make won't create it automatically.

<b>Additional practice:</b> (Not everyone will be able to do all of these, and that's fine.)
<ol>
  <li>Add or modify rules/recipes to run, diff, and tablen the output, as well. You'll need
    to create a master output file.</li>
<p>
  <li>If the build, run, and diff were successful, modify the rule to then
    zip up all of the source files that would be uploaded to the submission 
    server (had this been a real assignment).</li>
<p>
  <li>Practice overriding other macros (e.g. <tt>CLFAGS</tt>, <tt>EXE</tt>) from
    the command line.</li>
<p>
  <li>Add or modify rules/recipes to also run Doxygen. You will need to Doxygenize the
    source files, of course.</li>
<p>
  <li>For those that have <b>clang</b> installed and working (very easy in Linux and Mac), 
    make a <tt>clang</tt>
    directory and use the <tt>makefile</tt> file to build the project in the
    <tt>clang</tt> directory. DO NOT modify <tt>makefile</tt>. Override
    the relevant macros on the command line. 
    (The name of the compiler is <tt>clang</tt> and the compiler options are the same
    as <tt>gcc</tt>.)</li>

<p>
  <li>If you don't have <b>clang</b> (and most of you probably don't), then do the
    same thing with <b>g++</b>. Since all of our CS120 programs were 100% C++ compatible,
    you should not have to make any changes. Make sure you create a <tt><b>gpp</b></tt>
    directory first. In general, file and directory names should follow the rules for
    C identifiers (letters, numbers, underscores only). It will cause a lot less
    headaches in the future. For similar reasons, you wouldn't want to put a leading
    minus sign on a file. (It will be interpreted as an option, e.g. <tt>-ansi</tt>).


<p>
     <li>If you are familiar with Microsoft's compiler and options (and are using Windows), 
     create a makefile that will allow you to build the project with that
     compiler.</li>

<p>
  <li>If you are familiar with revision control systems (e.g. git, svn), add a rule that will
    put the files into the RCS. You might invoke make like this:
<blockquote><pre>
make git
</pre></blockquote>
    which would put the modified source files into the version control system
    (whichever system you are using). You wouldn't want to add this to the 
    primary rule, as it would put the files into RCS <b>every time</b> that 
    you modified the code!
    </li>
</ol>

<p class="technote">
<b>Summary</b>: It should be pretty obvious by now that using makefiles can <i>significantly</i> reduce the amount
of repetitive work that you have to do. This is why <b>make</b> was created. 
As we all know, programmers are inherently lazy when it comes to repetition!
<br><br>
With a little
effort up front, you can save a lot of effort later.
Not only 
does it reduce the workload, but once the makefile is created, it removes any
possibility of making errors and guarantees that every step is executed in the
proper order, e.g. you'll never forget to run tablen again!
<br><br>
Of course, once you have a working makefile for a project, re-using it for other
projects is usually a simple matter of changing a few lines to suit the new project's
file names.
</p>

<p class="technote">
<b>Challenge for the hard-core student</b>: Write a program that will automatically create
a makefile (or at least a partial makefile) from a given set of files.
There are many ways to attempt this from fully-automated
(open each source file in the directory and look for local includes) to providing the
program some hints in the form of command-line arguments.
<br><br>
<b>Hint</b>: Run <font color="blue"><tt>gcc -MM main.c</tt></font> to see how to get <i>gcc</i> help with this task.
<br><br>
Every semester I see a few dedicated students that attempt this!
</p>

<p class="Extra">
<b>Mead's Rule of Automation</b>: If I'm going to do something more than <i>three times</i>, I will
automate the process!

A POSIX example:
<p>
<b>Output</b> (program is called <b><tt>sem</tt></b>) The numbers in parentheses
in the second column are the number of threads in the critical section.

The problem is in the thread function. The 3rd printf statement is <b>not</b> in the critical section:

<!-- 
The 3rd printf statement in the thread function is not in the critical secion.

<pre class="sourcecode"><code><font color="#003399"><i>/* sem.c                                             */</i></b></font>
<b>void</b> *ThreadFn(<b>void</b> *p)
{
  <b>struct</b> ThreadParams *params = (<b>struct</b> ThreadParams *)p;
  sem_t *semaphore = params-&gt;semaphore;
  <b>int</b> tid = params-&gt;tid;
  
    <font color="#003399"><i>/* Acquire semaphore */</i></b></font>
  <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/sem_wait.html">sem_wait</a>(semaphore); 
  printf(<font color="#9933CC">&quot;ThreadId %i: acquired semaphore&#92;n&quot;</b></font>, tid);

    <font color="#003399"><i>/* Pretend to do some work */</i></b></font>
  printf(<font color="#9933CC">&quot;ThreadId %i: working...&#92;n&quot;</b></font>, tid);
  sleep(1);
  
    <font color="#003399"><i>/* Release semaphore */</i></b></font>
  <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/sem_post.html">sem_post</a>(semaphore); 
  printf(<font color="black">&quot;ThreadId %i: released semaphore&#92;n&quot;</b></font>, tid);  <font color="black"><b><i> <big><big>&larr;</big></big> <big>This is not protected!</i></b></font></big>
  
  <b>return</b> 0;
}
</code></pre>

The simple and obvious solution is to just put the print statement in the critical section:

<pre class="sourcecode"><code><font color="#003399"><i>/* sem.c                                             */</i></b></font>
<b>void</b> *ThreadFn(<b>void</b> *p)
{
  <b>struct</b> ThreadParams *params = (<b>struct</b> ThreadParams *)p;
  sem_t *semaphore = params-&gt;semaphore;
  <b>int</b> tid = params-&gt;tid;
    
  <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/sem_wait.html">sem_wait</a>(semaphore); <font color="#003399"><i>/* Acquire semaphore */</i></b></font>

    printf(<font color="#9933CC">&quot;ThreadId %i: acquired semaphore&#92;n&quot;</b></font>, tid);

      <font color="#003399"><i>/* Pretend to do some work */</i></b></font>
    printf(<font color="#9933CC">&quot;ThreadId %i: working...&#92;n&quot;</b></font>, tid);
    sleep(1);
  
    printf(<font color="#9933CC">&quot;ThreadId %i: released semaphore&#92;n&quot;</b></font>, tid);  <font color="black"><b><i> <big><big>&larr;</big></big> <big>Now this is protected.</i></b></font></big>
    
  <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/sem_post.html">sem_post</a>(semaphore); <font color="#003399"><i>/* Release semaphore */</i></b></font>
  
  <b>return</b> 0;
}
</code></pre>

Why did the other runs succeed?

Luck.

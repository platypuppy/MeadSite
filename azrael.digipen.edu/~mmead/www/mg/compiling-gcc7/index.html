Overview
</p>
</a>
Linux distributions generally come with a specific version of the GCC compilers and it
takes some effort (usually, only just a little effort) to install newer versions of the compilers.
This isn't usually a problem because many people upgrade their Linux distribution on a
regular basis and, therefore, get the newer versions of the compilers.
<p>
However:
<ol>
<li>Not everyone wants to upgrade their entire system just to get the latest compilers.</li>
<li>Sometimes a newer version of the compiler comes out way before a newer distribution
is going to be released.</li>
</ol>

I have been part of both reasons stated above. There are basically 3 ways that you would
get a compiler onto Linux:
<ol>
  <li>Install a Linux distribution and take the default compiler version that comes with it.</li>
  <li>Manually install additional compiler versions from the official repositories.
    (Linux makes it really easy to have multiple versions installed simultaneously.)</li>
  <li>Get the source code to the compiler you want and build/install it yourself.</li>
</ol>

This document is going to show how to do method #3 above. To install additional versions
via method #2, see my other guide: 
<a href="../update-compilers/index.html">Mead's Guide to Upgrading GCC and Clang on Linux</a>.
If your are running a recent version of Linux Mint, I recommend that you choose method #2
as it is faster, easier, and more likely to be successful.
<p>
When I first set out to do this, it was because I wanted to install GCC 7.1 on an iMac
running macOS 10.11 (El Capitan). It turns out that GCC isn't installed on the Mac. When
you run <tt>gcc</tt> or <tt>g++</tt>, you are really running <tt>clang</tt> and <tt>clang++</tt>,
as <tt>gcc</tt> and <tt>g++</tt> are just aliases for the Clang compilers. Once I had all
of this working on the Mac, I realized that the exact same procedure could be done on
Linux to get 7.1 built and installed there. Sweet!
<p>
<b>Disclaimer</b>: While I was searching on "how to install GCC on an iMac", I came across
this <a href="https://solarianprogrammer.com/2017/05/21/compiling-gcc-macos/">link</a>
which is the basis for this Guide. I basically took the information on that page and then
wrote a bash script which will automate the entire process on both Mac and Linux.

<blockquote>
<p class="technote">
<b>Note</b>: I am not an expert with macOS or with building compilers on macOS and Linux.
I followed the steps from the link above and successfully installed GCC 7.1 on both
platforms. It was relatively painless. There may be "better" ways to do this, and you
may actually know them. However, this technique I'm showing worked quite nicely
for me and I hope it works for you. If not, you can probably modify some of the steps
to suit you better.

Preparation
</p>
</a>
You might want to read the <a href="index.html#NOTES">Notes</a> at the bottom of this document
before you begin.
<p>
You'll need to download the source code for the compiler that you want. Choose a mirror
that's closest to you: <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/mirrors.html">GCC mirror sites</a>.
<p>
In order to build the GCC compilers, you have to first build a few prerequisite libraries.
Those libraries are:
<a href="http://www.multiprecision.org/index.php?prog=mpc&page=download">mpc</a>,
<a href="http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/#download">mpfr</a>, 
<a href="https://gmplib.org/">gmp</a>, and the
<a href="ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/infrastructure/">Graphite loop optimizations</a>.
<p>
To make life easier, I've downloaded all of these dependencies and am including them in a
zip file here: <a href="https://azrael.digipen.edu/~mmead/www/public/Files/gcc7.1-src.zip">gcc7.1-src.zip</a>.

You may want to actually download the latest versions
of these files from the links above, as the files I'm posting will be outdated at some point.
Either way, the process will be identical. You will just substitute the later versions for
the ones that I'm providing.

<blockquote>
<p class="technote">
The reason that I'm providing these files is because, when
I first began this process, a couple of the links were broken and I had difficulty finding
a working download link. A few days later, those links magically worked again. I can't
trust that the links won't get broken again, so I've made everything available in that
zip file for convenience.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It should also be obvious that, in order to build GCC, you must already have a working 
compiler installed on your computer! Any recent version of GCC (Linux) or Clang (Mac)
should be sufficient.
<p>

<b>Notes for building on Linux Mint</b>:
<p>
  If you have a fresh install of Linux Mint, you will need to install a couple of packages in order
  to build everything. These commands should do the trick:
<blockquote><pre>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc-multilib
</pre></blockquote>
  These packages will give you a proper build environment, including 32-bit support, which
  some of the libraries require.
<p>
<b>Notes for building on macOS</b>:
<p>
There is one step that has to be done first before compiling the source code on the Mac.
You must open a terminal and run the following:

<blockquote><pre>
xcode-select --install
</pre></blockquote>

This will install some command-line tools that are required to build the source code.
Once that is completed, you can now proceed to build and install the compilers.

  <p class="sectionheader">
Building and Installation
</p></a>
The first thing you should realize is that building and installing GCC 7.1 is not going
to interfere with any existing compilers on your computer. You will be building the source
code in a temporary directoring and installing the files to an alternate location that
isn't used by any other programs.
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>You will need about 7 GBs of space for all of the files that you are going to build.
(There will end up being over 100,000 files.)</b>
</blockquote>
<p>

 The location where the new files will be installed is here:

<blockquote><pre>
/usr/local/gcc-7.1
</pre></blockquote>

If you want to install it somewhere else, you can change the variable <tt>INSTALL_DIR</tt>
in the script to another location. When the entire process has completed, the installation
directory will contain these subdirectories:

<blockquote><pre>
bin
include
lib
lib32
lib64
libexec
share
</pre></blockquote>

The size of the installation is about on Linux is about 750 MB. The size on Mac is about 220 MB.
<p>
<b>Steps to build and install</b>:
<ol>
  <li>Get the archive of source files: <a href="https://azrael.digipen.edu/~mmead/www/public/Files/gcc7.1-src.zip">gcc7.1-src.zip</a> and put
    it in an empty temporary directory (somewhere under your home directory).</li>
    <p>
  <li>Extract the archive in the temp directory:
<blockquote><pre>
unzip gcc7.1-src.zip
</pre></blockquote>


   You should see these files:

<blockquote><pre>
<a href="cleanup.sh.txt">cleanup.sh</a>
gcc-7.1.0.tar.bz2
gmp-6.1.2.tar.bz2
<a href="install.sh.txt">install.sh</a>
isl-0.16.1.tar.bz2
<a href="main.cpp.txt">main.cpp</a>
mpc-1.0.3.tar.gz
mpfr-3.1.5.tar.bz2
<a href="remove-all.sh.txt">remove-all.sh</a>
</pre></blockquote>

You may have to make the scripts executable by doing this:
<blockquote><pre>
chmod +x *.sh
</pre></blockquote>

</li>

<li>Run the installation script:
<blockquote><pre>
./install.sh
</pre></blockquote>

This could take anywhere from 20 minutes to 4 hours, depending on the speed of your computer. These
are the times that I got from my computers:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>2007 iMac Core 2 Duo (2 threads, SSD) took 128 minutes to build.</li>
  <li>2012 iMac i5 (4 threads, SSD) took 41 minutes to build.</li>
  <li>Linux Mint computer with an i7 (8 threads, SSD) took 28 minutes to build.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Those are the kinds of times you should expect. All of those computers had an SSD. If you are using
a spinning hard disk, your times may be slightly longer. The largest factor in the speed of 
building is the number of cores your CPU has.
<p>
I made the installation script automatically adjust to the
number of cores you have, so a CPU with 2 threads will compile 2 files at once, and a CPU with 16
threads will compile 16 files at once. That is the beauty of make!

</li>
</ol>

<p>

At the end of the build/install process, a sample C++ program will be compiled and run
to verify that everything went well. The program will print out some numbers and stuff
and you should see these lines at the end:

<blockquote><pre class="bconsole">
****************************************************************
* If you see this text, your build and install was successful! *
* If you see this text, your build and install was successful! *
* If you see this text, your build and install was successful! *
****************************************************************

To use the new version, add this to your $PATH:

  /usr/local/gcc-7.1/bin

You should probably do this in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile file.
</pre></blockquote>

The test program advises you to add the <tt>bin</tt> directory in the installation
directory to your
PATH environment variable. Once you've done that, the compiler is ready to use.
<p>
To use the new version, you have to type:

<blockquote><pre>
g++-7.1
</pre></blockquote>

If you just type <tt>g++</tt>, you'll get the old version that was already installed on your 
computer.
<p>
Once you're sure that everything has been built and installed successfully, you can delete
all of the files in your temporary directory as they are no longer needed.
<p>

Notes
</p></a>

<ul>
  <li>I have only tested this with macOS El Capitan (version 10.11.x) and Linux Mint (versions 17.x and 18.x) and it
    has worked flawlessly. This script should work with any recent version of macOS or Linux, but
    it's up to you to make sure that you have the proper build tools installed. I am not familiar with
    other Linux distributions, so I can't tell you how to set them up properly to build complicated
    software (like compilers or operating systems.)

     If you don't know how to properly set up your Linux system
    then my recommendation is
    to use Linux Mint. Why? It. Just. Works.<sup>&trade;</sup></li>
<p>
  <li>You should build everything somewhere within your home directory as a normal user.
    In other words, don't build as <i>root</i>.</li>
<p>
  <li>However, you will need to be <i>root</i> to install the files. The script uses <b>sudo</b>
    for the installation steps.</li>
<p>
  <li>The first time the script runs <b>sudo</b>, you will be prompted for your password. If you
    run <b>sudo</b> again within 5 minutes (default timeout), you won't be prompted. Since compiling GCC itself
    is likely to take over 30 minutes, you will be prompted again for your password. This means that
    if you walk away during the long build, you may come back and find that the installation
    of GCC has paused, waiting for you to enter your password.
    If you want to make the timeout longer, check out this
    <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2016/05/05/change-sudo-password-timeout/">link</a> or just
    Google for "sudo timestamp_timeout".
  </li>
<p>
  <li>There's a simple bash script called
    <a href="cleanup.sh.txt">cleanup.sh</a> that will remove all of the temporary files (about 6 GBs)
    from the temporary directory.</li>
<p>
  <li>There's also a simple bash script called
    <a href="remove-all.sh.txt">remove-all.sh</a> that will remove all of the temporary files (about 6 GBs)
    from the temporary directory AND all of the files that were installed in the installation
    directory (<tt>/usr/local/gcc-7.1</tt>) I used these scripts as I was developing them, and had
    to constantly delete everything and start again. Hey, that's what TESTING is all about!
    You are TESTING your own code, right?

  </li>
<p>
  <li>Feel free to modify the scripts as you see fit. The install script is somewhat documented and fairly
    straight-forward.</li>

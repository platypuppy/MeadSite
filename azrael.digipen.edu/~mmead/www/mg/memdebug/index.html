Background
</p>

There are several tools available to help you find memory bugs in your programs.
This document will discuss two of them: Dr. Memory and Valgrind.
<ol>
  <li><a href="http://www.drmemory.org/">Dr. Memory</a> &mdash;
<i>"Dr. Memory is a memory monitoring tool capable of identifying memory-related
 programming errors such as accesses of uninitialized memory, accesses to 
 unaddressable memory (including outside of allocated heap units and heap 
 underflow and overflow), accesses to freed memory, double frees, memory leaks,
  and (on Windows) handle leaks, GDI API usage errors, and accesses to 
  un-reserved thread local storage slots."</i>
  <p>
  Dr. Memory operates on unmodified application binaries running on Windows, 
  Linux, Mac, or Android on commodity IA-32, AMD64, and ARM hardware.
  <p>
  <b>Pros:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.</li>
    <li>Easy to use (no source code changes).</li>
    <li>Faster than other memory debuggers.</li>
    <li>Freely available.</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  <b>Cons:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Some functionality missing with 64-bit Windows.</li>
    <li>Doesn't work well with Windows 10.</li>
    <li>Doesn't work with Cygwin's gcc/g++ compilers.</li>
    <!--<li>Must be manually installed.</li>-->
    <li>May require special compiler options to work properly.</li>
    <li>Only detects memory-related bugs.</li>
  </ul>
  
  </li>
  <p>
  <li><a href="http://www.valgrind.org/">Valgrind</a> &mdash;
<i>"Valgrind is a GPL'd system for debugging and profiling Linux and Mac programs. 
With Valgrind's tool suite you can automatically detect many memory management
and threading bugs, avoiding hours of frustrating bug-hunting, making your
 programs more stable. You can also perform detailed profiling to help speed
  up your programs."</i>
<p>
Valgrind runs on several popular platforms, such as x86, AMD64 and PPC32.
Read more about the benefits of using Valgrind <a href="http://www.valgrind.org/info/about.html">here</a>.

  <p>
  <b>Pros:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Easy to use (no source code changes).</li>
    <li>Easy to install.</li>
    <li>Generally doesn't need any special compiler options.</li>
    <li>Works well with 32-bit and 64-bit.</li>
    <li>Includes an entire suite of debugging tools (not just memory debugging.)</li>
    <li>Freely available.</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  <b>Cons:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Not available for Windows.</li>
    <li>Can be slower than other memory debuggers.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

Dr. Memory
</p>
</a>

On Windows, you can use either MinGW or Microsoft's compiler to build programs
that Dr. Memory can check. In order for Dr. Memory to work correctly, you may need to
compile your program with special command line options. 
Refer to <a href="http://drmemory.org/docs/page_prep.html">
Preparing Your Application</a> on their website for detailed information.
<blockquote>
<p class="technote">
Although Dr. Memory will work with Windows, Mac, and Linux, I'm only going to 
show how to use it under Windows because Valgrind is a better choice if you're
running Mac or Linux. Also, the version of Dr. Memory used for these examples is <b>1.11.0 -- build 2</b>.
(Current version is 2.2.0 -- build 1)
</p>
</blockquote>

We're going to use this file: <a href="mem.bugs.cpp">mem.bugs.cpp</a>
(<a href="mem.bugs.cpp.html">HTML</a>),
that has several memory-related bugs:
<p>

<ol>
  <li>test1 - simple memory leak</li>
  <li>test2 - allocate with <i>new[]</i>, deallocate with <i>delete</i></li>
  <li>test3 - allocate with <i>new</i>, deallocate with <i>delete[]</i></li>
  <li>test4 - allocate with <i>malloc</i>, deallocate with <i>delete</i></li>
  <li>test5 - allocate with <i>new</i>, deallocate with <i>free</i></li>
  <li>test6 - buffer overflow</li>
  <li>test7 - unitialized read (unsupported on 64-bit Windows)</li>
</ol>

Both memory debuggers can detect more errors than the ones listed, but this
should give you an idea of how to use them. To experiment with code that has
more errors, try this one: 
<a href="mem.leaks.cpp">mem.leaks.cpp</a> (<a href="mem.leaks.cpp.html">HTML</a>).
<ul>

<li>
<b>MinGW</b> (gcc/g++)
<p>
First, we need to compile <i>mem.bugs.cpp</i> with the
appropriate options:
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
g++ <b>-ggdb</b> mem.bugs.cpp -o mingw64.exe
</pre></blockquote>

The <i>-ggdb</i> option adds additional debugging information (e.g. filenames
and line numbers) to the executable so the debugger can tell you where the 
problems are located.
<p>
Running the program under Dr. Memory (test #1, memory leak):

<blockquote><pre>
<b>drmemory</b> -batch -no_summary -- mingw64.exe 1
</pre></blockquote>

and the output (I've highlighted the important lines)

<blockquote><pre>
~~Dr.M~~
<b>~~Dr.M~~ Error #1: LEAK 123 direct bytes 0x0000000003220a50-0x0000000003220acb + 0 indirect bytes</b>

</pre></blockquote>

The <i>-no_summary</i> option tells Dr. Memory to only output information when there are problems.
Without the option, Dr. Memory will display several lines of output, even if there were no
problems. Like most <i>good</i> command line tools, silence (no output) indicates success.
<p>
You can see by the output that Dr. Memory has detected the memory leak of 
123 bytes at line #7 in the source file: 

<blockquote><pre>
1  <font color="990099">#include &lt;iostream&gt;</font>
2  <font color="990099">#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;</font>
3  <font color="990099">#include &lt;cstring&gt;</font>
4
5  <b>void</b> test1()
6  {
7    <b>new</b> <b>char</b>[123];
8  }
9
</pre></blockquote>

The output shows that on line #72 (in the function <i>main</i>), there is a call
to a function (<i>test1</i>). The memory was allocated on line #7 in function
<i>test1</i>. All of the lines above <i>test1</i> can be ignored as they are
functions in the runtime libraries.
<p>
If you were to compile the program using the 32-bit MinGW compiler, you would
see this output similar to this:


<blockquote><pre>
~~Dr.M~~
~~Dr.M~~ Error #1: POSSIBLE LEAK 28 direct bytes 0x02db00f8-0x02db0114 + 0 indirect bytes

</pre></blockquote>

Again, I've highlighted the important lines. You'll also see that there is 
a <i>POSSIBLE LEAK</i> of 28 bytes that is shown. Since none of the lines 
regarding that leak contain references
to the code in <i>mem.bugs.cpp</i>, you can ignore them. (You may or may not see
the possible leak.)

<p class="technote">
<b>Note:</b> If Dr. Memory fails to detect errors with your 64-bit MinGW programs, you should rebuild
them as 32-bit MinGW programs, instead. There are known problems with some Windows 10 computers and 
Dr. Memory running 64-bit programs. If that still doesn't work on your computer, then
you should use Microsoft's compiler, which is detailed next.

You can see by the output that Dr. Memory has detected the memory leak of 
123 bytes at line #7 in the source file, just as it did with the MinGW executable.
<p>
If you were to compile the program using Microsoft's 32-bit compiler, you would
see this output similar to this:

</li>

<p class="technote">
<b>Note:</b> To compile with Microsoft's compilers from the command line, 
you must enable the developer environment at the command

<tt><b>setvc17-32</b></tt> at the command line. The commands are custom-made
batch files.
<br><br>
For best results, you should open two command windows and type the 32-bit

in the other. Typing both in the same

<a name="VALGRIND">
<p class="SectionHeader">
Valgrind
</p>
</a>

<a href="http://www.valgrind.org/">Valgrind</a> is only available for Linux and Mac, and I will be showing it on Linux. Valgrind
is also a suite of tools that can look for problems other than memory. Read the documentation
to see all of the things that it can do. The version of Valgrind used for these examples
is <b>3.10.1</b>.
<p>
The first thing is to compile. The recommended options are <tt>-g</tt>
(include debugging information) and <tt>-O0</tt>
(disable optimizations, that's an uppercase letter 'O' followed by a zero):

<blockquote><pre>
g++ <b>-g -O0</b> -o gnu64 mem.bugs.cpp
</pre></blockquote>

Valgrind works the same way in both 32-bit and 64-bit programs, so I'm just going
to show the 64-bit output.
<p>

Running the program (test #1, memory leak) under Valgrind:

<blockquote><pre>
valgrind ./gnu64 1
</pre></blockquote>

produces this output:

<blockquote><pre>

==25831== For counts of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -v
==25831== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)
</pre></blockquote>

I highlighted the important part which shows the 123 bytes of memory that was
not deallocated. There's also a false-positive leak of 72,827 bytes. I'll show
how to suppress that later. 
There is a lot of "noise" being output, so we're going to suppress
a lot of that. Do that with the <tt>--quiet</tt> option:

<blockquote><pre>
valgrind <b>--quiet</b> ./gnu64 1
</pre></blockquote>

Unfortunately, this has suppressed all of the output so we need to enable some
of it:

<blockquote><pre>
valgrind --quiet <b>--leak-check=full</b> ./gnu64 1
</pre></blockquote>

Now the output looks like this:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>==26112== 123 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 2</b>
==26112==    at 0x4C2B800: operator new[](unsigned long) (in /usr/lib/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)

==26112==    by 0xFFEFFFD46: ???
==26112==    by 0xFFEFFFD4E: ???
==26112== 
</pre></blockquote>

It shows exactly what we wanted, including the filename and line numbers where to 
look.
<p>
Ok, let's suppress the false-positive since it's going to show up in every
test. I'm just going to give a quick
overview of how to do that. For more details, read
<a href="http://www.valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual-core.html#manual-core.suppress">Suppressing errors</a>
and <a href="http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/mc-manual.html#mc-manual.suppfiles">Writing suppression files</a>.
<p>
First, you have to generate a suppression file:

<blockquote><pre>
valgrind --quiet --leak-check=full <nobr><b>--gen-suppressions=yes</b></nobr> ./gnu64 1
</pre></blockquote>

Now, when you run it you'll see this:

<blockquote><pre>
==26594== 123 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 2
==26594==    at 0x4C2B800: operator new[](unsigned long) (in /usr/lib/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
==26594==    by 0x400AA4: test1() (mem.bugs.cpp:7)
==26594==    by 0x400C88: main (mem.bugs.cpp:72)
==26594== 
==26594== 
==26594== ---- Print suppression ? --- [Return/N/n/Y/y/C/c] ---- 
</pre></blockquote>

Valgrind has paused and the last line is prompting you to 
answer the question <i>Print suppression ?</i> Since the
memory leak being shown is an actual memory leak, you DO NOT want to suppress that. If you
do, Valgrind will not report it as a leak anymore, which is not what we want. 
Press <i>n</i> to skip the suppression.
<p>

Now, Valgrind displays the false-postive and asks again if you want to suppress this:

<blockquote><pre>

You'll notice that none of the lines reference our source code (<i>mem.bugs.cpp</i>), which
is a good sign that the leak is not in our code.
<p>

This time, type <i>y</i> to generate the suppression output. This is what Valgrind
displays on my computer:

<blockquote><pre>
{
   &lt;insert_a_suppression_name_here&gt;
   Memcheck:Leak
   match-leak-kinds: reachable
   fun:malloc
   obj:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6.0.25
   fun:call_init.part.0
   fun:call_init
   fun:_dl_init
   obj:/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.19.so
   obj:*
   obj:*
   obj:*
}
</pre></blockquote>

You need to copy the text (including the curly braces) and paste it into a text
file that will be used as the suppression file. You can name the text file
anything you want. I usually name my suppression files <tt><b>false.supp</b></tt>, but you
can name it anything.

<blockquote>
<p class="technote">
<b>Note:</b> Do <b>NOT</b> copy the text from this web page. Every system produces
a different suppression file. If you just copy the one from this web page, it
won't work. You must generate the file on your particular computer.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Now, when you run Valgrind, you will specify this suppression file on the command
line so that Valgrind will ignore (suppress) the false-positive:

<blockquote><pre>
valgrind --quiet --leak-check=full <b>--suppressions=false.supp</b> ./gnu64 1
</pre></blockquote>

This assumes that you put the suppression file in the same directory that you
are running in. Now, the output looks like this:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>==27200== 123 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 2</b>
==27200==    at 0x4C2B800: operator new[](unsigned long) (in /usr/lib/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
<b>==27200==    by 0x400AA4: test1() (mem.bugs.cpp:7)</b>
<b>==27200==    by 0x400C88: main (mem.bugs.cpp:72)</b>
==27200== 
</pre></blockquote>

which contains just the memory leak that we put in the code.




<blockquote>
<p class="technote">
<b>Pro Tip:</b> Since this false-positive will show up in <i>every</i> program
you run, you'll want to put this file in some other location and refer to that
location. You don't want to have dozens (or hundreds) of these files around
because, as you'll shortly see, when the suppression file needs to be updated,
you don't want to have to update 100 of them. You could put the file in your
<tt>bin</tt> directory in your home directory
(for example: <tt>/home/user/bin/false.supp</tt>).
Yeah, it's not a binary file (executable), but the <tt>bin</tt> directory in my
home directory is a convenient location and exists on all systems I use.
</p>
</blockquote>

Now, run Valgrind like this:
<blockquote><pre>
valgrind --quiet --leak-check=full <b>--suppressions=/home/user/bin/false.supp</b> ./gnu64 1
</pre></blockquote>

Now, you can use this suppression file for all of your programs, regardless of
where they are on your computer.

<blockquote>
<p class="technote">
<b>Note:</b> The suppression files are specific to the versions of the operating
system, compiler, libraries, and Valgrind. You may find that, if you update any of these
things that you will have to re-generate the suppression file. You can see this
in the suppression file as it references version 6.0.25 of <i>libstdc++.so</i>. If this
library gets updated, the suppression file will no longer work.
</blockquote>

This is the only false-positive that Valgrind is showing and it's coming from the
standard C++ library <i>libstdc++.so</i>. Depending on what kinds of other libraries/code
you include in your program, you may get more, sometimes <i>MANY</i> more, false-positives.
You would simply run Valgrind with the <nobr><tt><b>--gen-suppressions=yes</b></tt></nobr> option
and copy/paste the output into the same suppression file. That's why there are curly
braces in the output. The lines of text between each pair of curly braces refers
to one false-positive. There is no limit to how many of these suppression lines
can be put into the file. (I've got suppression files that have over 5,000 lines in them!
Thank you, Qt libraries...)
<p>
Finally, you'll notice that the first line of the suppression text was this:

<blockquote><pre>
{
   <b>&lt;insert_a_suppression_name_here&gt;</b>
   Memcheck:Leak
   . . .
}
</pre></blockquote>

This is so you can give a name to the suppression block. It's unused by Valgrind,
but it allows you to document what the block is suppressing. I usually change it
to this:

</pre></blockquote>
<blockquote><pre>
{
   <b>[false positive from libstdc++]</b>
   Memcheck:Leak
   . . .
}
</pre></blockquote>

It doesn't matter what you call it but it must be present. Valgrind skips the
first non-blank line of each block, so if it's not there, the suppression won't 
work.

<b>Tracking File Descriptors with Valgrind</b>
<p>
Valgrind can do a lot more than just detect memory bugs. I'm going to show one more
thing that Valgrind can detect. Many beginning programmers fail to close files when
they are done with them. This can lead to problems.
<p>
Tracking file descriptors is a fancy way of saying that you can detect files that
were not closed (e.g. via <i>fclose</i>). File handles (descriptors) are a finite resource just
like memory, and if you fail to close them, you can run out of them (just like memory).
Valgrind has an option that enables this check. Here's a starting place (<tt>fd.c</tt>):

<blockquote><pre>
<b>int</b> main()
{
  <b>return</b> 0;
}
</pre></blockquote>

This is a complete program that doesn't do anything. Or does it?

Build it:
<blockquote><pre>
gcc fd.c -g -o fd
</pre></blockquote>

and run Valgrind on it with the appropriate option:

<blockquote><pre>
valgrind -q <b>--track-fds=yes</b> ./fd
</pre></blockquote>

and this is the output:

<blockquote><pre>
==31318== FILE DESCRIPTORS: 3 open at exit.
==31318== Open file descriptor 2: /dev/pts/2
==31318==    &lt;inherited from parent&gt;
==31318== 
==31318== Open file descriptor 1: /dev/pts/2
==31318==    &lt;inherited from parent&gt;
==31318== 
==31318== Open file descriptor 0: /dev/pts/2
==31318==    &lt;inherited from parent&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

Valgrind is saying that we have 3 leaks. They are not memory leaks, they are
resource leaks, file descriptors, to be exact. But the code didn't open any files!
Think back to your beginning C/C++ programming course and you'll remember that when
your program runs, three "files" are opened for you:

<ol>
  <li><i>stdin</i> - By default, this is the keyboard (opened for input, fd 0).</li>
  <li><i>stdout</i> - By default, this is the screen (opened for output, fd 1).</li>
  <li><i>stderr</i> - By default, this is the screen (opened for output, fd 2).</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p class="technote">
These three files are also referenced as file descriptors 0, 1, and 2. 
(Sometimes refered to as <i>file handles</i>.)
The operating systems keeps
track of open files using integers. File descriptors 0, 1, and 2 are generally reserved
for those three files. When a file is opened, the lowest unused integer (i.e. 3) is used.
That's why when you open the first file in your program, it will
<i>always</i> be file descriptor 3. If you open a second file, it will be file descriptor 4,
and so on.
</p>
</blockquote>

You don't have to open these files, as they are already opened for you. You also don't have
to close them, as the system will close them when the program ends. They show up
as being still open because they aren't closed until long after <i>main</i> finishes.
That means these are false-positives that we can ignore. (Also, notice that
they were </i>inherited from the parent</i>.)
<p>
OK, let's open a file and "forget" to close it:

<blockquote><pre>
<font color="990099">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; /* FILE, fopen */</font>

<b>void</b> test1()
{
    <font color="990099">/* Open a file, but don't close it. */</font>
  FILE *fp = fopen(<font color="#9933CC">&quot;foo.txt&quot;</font>, <font color="#9933CC">&quot;wt&quot;</font>);
}

<b>int</b> main()
{
  test1();
  <b>return</b> 0;
}
</pre></blockquote>

Now, running it under Valgrind produces this output:

<blockquote><pre>
==4960== FILE DESCRIPTORS: 4 open at exit.
<b>==4960== Open file descriptor 3: foo.txt</b>
==4960==    at 0x4F26170: __open_nocancel (syscall-template.S:81)
==4960==    by 0x4EB0ED7: _IO_file_open (fileops.c:228)
==4960==    by 0x4EB0ED7: _IO_file_fopen@@GLIBC_2.2.5 (fileops.c:333)
==4960==    by 0x4EA53D3: __fopen_internal (iofopen.c:90)
<b>==4960==    by 0x40052D: test1 (fd.c:5)</b>
<b>==4960==    by 0x400542: main (fd.c:10)</b>
==4960== 
==4960== Open file descriptor 2: /dev/pts/2
==4960==    &lt;inherited from parent&gt;
==4960== 
==4960== Open file descriptor 1: /dev/pts/2
==4960==    &lt;inherited from parent&gt;
==4960== 
==4960== Open file descriptor 0: /dev/pts/2
==4960==    &lt;inherited from parent&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

You can see that there is a fourth file descriptor shown (file descriptor 3) which is the
file that our program opened for writing. It also shows you the line number that
opened the file. This makes it pretty easy to locate bugs (file leaks) in your program.
<p>
One last thing to mention. You'll see that the first 3 file descriptors don't reference
any filenames (they use pseudo-terminals). If you were to redirect <i>stdin</i>, 
<i>stdout</i>, and <i>stderr</i> (assume <tt>in.txt</tt> exists):

<blockquote><pre>
valgrind -q --track-fds=yes ./fd <b>&lt; in.txt &gt; out.txt 2&gt; err.txt</b>
</pre></blockquote>

you would see something like this output from Valgrind:

<blockquote><pre>
==10412== FILE DESCRIPTORS: 3 open at exit.
==10412== Open file descriptor 2: /home/user/data/courses/notes/code/drmem/err.txt
==10412==    &lt;inherited from parent&gt;
==10412== 
==10412== Open file descriptor 1: /home/user/data/courses/notes/code/drmem/out.txt
==10412==    &lt;inherited from parent&gt;
==10412== 
==10412== Open file descriptor 0: /home/user/data/courses/notes/code/drmem/in.txt
==10412==    &lt;inherited from parent&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

Valgrind shows the actual names of the files that are used with the redirection.
Pretty cool!

<!--  
There's one caveat to watch out for, though. If you redirect the output from the program
to a file, Valgrind will detect yet-another file that is opened. It doesn't even matter
that our program isn't outputting anything. Going back to the original do-nothing program:

<b>int</b> main()
{
  <b>return</b> 0;
}
</pre></blockquote>

and running it like this:

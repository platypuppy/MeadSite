Think that documenting your code is all black and white? Think that there is one "right" way? Think that 
all developers are in agreement? Think you can call yourself a professional without knowing how to properly
document your code? Think again. This "religious" issue was
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/02/05/19/2216233.shtml">debated on slashdot</a>
a while ago.

Core Files and Stuff

<ul>
<!--
<li><a href="../../Files/Doxygen/doxygen-1.4.4-setup.exe"> Local download</a> This might not be the latest, but
it is what is currently used at DigiPen. (Version 1.4.4)
-->
<li><a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html">Download from the web</a> This should
always point to the latest version.
<!--
<li><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/macro/KingsTools.asp">Doxygen plugin for .NET</a> If you're using .NET,
you can get a Doxygen plugin from here.
-->
<!--
<li><a href="http://mypage.bluewin.ch/TheEdge/doxygen_index.html">DoxygenStudio</a> is a free Visual Studio-like
IDE for Doxygen.

<li><a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/helpers.html">Doxygen related tools</a> More helper
tools and scripts for Doxygen.
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p class="technote">
There is an excellent help file that is included with Doxygen. It explains everything you need to know
to use Doxygen. You'll find it in the directory where Doxygen is installed. (It's in the Start menu as well.)

Simple Example (using yet-another Stack class)
</p>

<ul>
<li>Sample <a href="stack.h.html">interface</a> file and 
<a href="stack.cpp.html">implementation</a> file. 
<!--
There's a Visual Studio project 
<a href="Stacks.zip">zipped up here</a>.
-->
<li><a href="html/index.html">HTML</a> version using Doxygen. 
<!--
<a href="html/index.chm">Compiled Help</a> version generated from Doxygen. 
(May need to download it in order to view it.)
-->
<li>A sample <a href="Doxyfile.html">configuration template</a> for Doxygen used to produce the Stack documentation.
Save this to your hard drive.

Visual Studio Add-in, Macros, and Other Coolness
</p>

<ul>
<li>You'll need the Microsoft <a href="http://www.digipen.edu/~mmead/www/Files/htmlhelp.zip">HTML Help Compiler</a>
to create compiled HTML help (.chm) files.

<li>Macros for Visual Studio (may already be installed in VS 6.0 at DigiPen)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../Files/Doxygen/doxbar-0.12.bin.zip">Doxbar</a> is a free Visual Studio add-in that 
integrates into the IDE for Visual Studio 6.0. It just doesn't get any easier than this. This version isn't the latest,
but I find it works better with the version of Doxygen installed here at DigiPen.
The official SourceForge project can be found <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/doxbar/">here.</a> 
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have a <b>TEMP</b> folder on your C: drive
<li>When you enter <b>UserTool8</b> (or whatever the number happens to be on your computer), make sure
you use uppercase <b>U</b> and <b>T</b>. (It will fail if you don't.)
<li>You can ignore the <b>Using the HELP</b> section in the instructions.
<li>You'll need to point the tool at a <b>Configuration Template</b>. Use the one listed above, or you
can create one from the command line with Doxygen.exe. Read the Doxygen Help file for more details.
</ul>
	
<li>If you want to automate the process of creating function header comments, I wrote a macro that you
can download. It's a file named <a href="DoxMacros.dsm">DoxMacros.dsm</a>. This integrates with Visual Studio
and will generate Doxygen-style function header comments. It's not 100%, but it handles
a lot of the cases. To learn how to add macros to the IDE, choose <b><u>M</u>acro...</b> from the
<b><u>T</u>ools</b> menu and then click on the <b>Macro <u>H</u>elp</b> button. 
(This is a work in-progress. Also, don't be alarmed that it is limited. If you want a challenge, I invite
you to write a C++ parser in VBScript. You'll get an automatic A in the class.)
<li>Here is a simple <a href="VCMacros.exe">GUI "wizard"</a> for customizing the functionality
of the macro above. (This is also a work in-progress. It allows you to "preview" some of the formatting
capabilities of the macro.)

<li><a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/">Literate Programming</a> Interestingly, this concept has been
around for about 20 years. 
<blockquote>
<b>From the FAQ:</b>
<br>
"In general, literate programs combine source and documentation in a single file. Literate 
programming tools then parse the file to produce either readable documentation or compilable source."
<p>
<b>From Donald Knuth:</b>
<br>
"Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining 
that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining 
to human beings what we want a computer to do."
</blockquote>
<li><a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/ftools.html">Tools for Literate Programming</a> Doxygen is just
one of dozens of tools for professional developers. There are many other very powerful (some FREE!) tools 
for communicating your code to humans.

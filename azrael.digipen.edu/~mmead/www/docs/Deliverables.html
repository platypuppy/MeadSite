What are Deliverables?
</p>

Quite simply put, deliverables are those tangible items that are to be delivered to the client upon completion of work. 
This may include things like source code, compiled executable code, help files, test results, product designs, 
documentation, training, and just about anything else a client may request. The important thing to remember is that
the <i>client</i> specifies the deliverables, not the developer. How the items are delivered can be negotiated (e.g. submit
source code on a CD or via email.)
<p>
In our classes, I (the instructor) am the client and you (the student) are the hired developer. As the client, I specify what
the deliverables are, how they are to be delivered, and when they are to be delivered. Once the items are delivered, you will
get paid. Of course, as the Dalai Lama <a href="http://www.carlspackler.com/verbatim.html">said</a>
to Carl Spackler "Oh, uh, there won't be any money..." Instead, you will be compensated with
a grade for the assignment. The size of your "paycheck" (the grade you receive) will be proportional to the degree in which
you have met the requirements. So, if you only meet a portion of the requirements satisfactorily, 
you'll only receive a portion of a "paycheck" (a score less than 100%).
<p>
In the "Real World", you usually don't get "partial" credit, meaning that you get paid only if 100% of the
items are delivered to the client's satisfaction. This means that if you only finish 95% of the project, you don't get 95% of your 
pay. You get nothing until all of it is finished. Since we can't work quite that way here (due to time constraints), 
you will get partial "pay" for submitting partially completed/satisfactory work.
<p>
For each programming exercise, most of the information regarding deliverables is specified in the handout for the assignment. 
Most of the criteria is the same from assignment to assignment, with the exception of the task (algorithm, program) being
developed. Exactly what needs to be delivered will be specified on the the handout. The common criteria for deliverables
are discussed in this document.

Hardcopy Requirements (if required)
</p>
The hardcopy must be printed in portrait mode (no landscape) using a <b>fixed-pitch font</b> (e.g. Courier). 
The size of the font should be between 7 and 10 points.
This is to help ensure that there is no wordwrapping in the output (and also to help keep the number of pages to a minimum.)
Word-wrap is great for word-processing, but it is totally unacceptable for source code. 
(Ever notice that there is no capability to enable word-wrap in a programmer's editor like Visual Studio or SynEdit?) 
Of course, if you like to type very long lines in your programs, your lines may still word-wrap even when printed in 
a small point size. You will have to be aware of this before you print it out because you may end up having to edit 
your source code and re-print the entire program if any lines word-wrap. (Or, leave the word-wrapped lines and then
receive a lower score due to failure to meet the client's requirements as specified.)
If you want to have long lines in your source, it is up to you to make sure you can print without the lines wrapping.
Also, watch out for large tab sizes and large margins. These attributes are probably the cause of most 
word-wrapping during printing. If you can't get Visual Studio (or whatever you use to write code) to 
format your output properly, use some other software that will allow you to control all aspects of the output. There
are tons of free tools out on the Internet for formatting source code. You just need to look for it. Here are a few

Use of Doxygen
</p>
Doxygen tags must be used to markup your internal documentation (comments). For details on Doxygen and an example of a <i>Doxygenized</i> source file, 
look <a href="doxygen/index.html">here</a>. The <i>minimum</i> tags required are:

<ul>
<li><b>file</b> - Used in the file header comment to name the source file.
<li><b>author</b> - Used in the file header comment for your name.
<li><b>date</b> - Used in the file header comment for the date the assignment is due.
<li><b>brief</b> - Used in the file header comment to list the contents of the file (usually the functions/methods in the file). This 
is also used in a function header comment to describe the purpose of the function.
<li><b>param</b> - Used in a function header comment for each parameter. (Omit if there are no parameters).
<li><b>return</b> - Used in a function header comment to document the return value. (Omit if there is no return).
<li><b>exception</b> - Used in a function header comment to document the exceptions that are thrown. (C++ only).
<li><b>par</b> - Used for free-form information (e.g. Course, section, assignment #, etc.)
</ul>

To include other pieces of information that don't have specific tags (e.g. the course name), you can use a <b>par</b> tag (paragraph)
in the file header comment. The examples show how to do this.
<p>

Note that in C++ code, it may be cleaner to describe the class using a <b>class</b> tag, rather than to put the information in the
file header comment. This <a href="doxygen/stack.h.html">header file</a> demonstrates the <b>class</b> tag. The HTML generated from
the <b>class</b> tag is <a href="doxygen/html/classStack.html">here</a> (under the Detailed Description section). Also note that these
tags listed above are the <i>minimum</i> requirements. For example, it is common to markup the text with HTML tags within the comments. 
<p>
Doxygen includes an excellent and exhaustive compiled help file that describes all of the commands 
and tags that are available and how to use them. It is installed with Doxygen on your computers.

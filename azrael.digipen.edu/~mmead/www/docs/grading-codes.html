<p class="SectionHeader">
What Do They Mean?
</p>

There are several aspects on which all of your programming assignments will be graded. Each aspect
is associated with a code, usually 2 letters, but sometimes more. The meaning of the most common ones
are explained below.

<ul>
<!--
<li><tt><b>CW</b></tt> Compiler Warnings - This means that your code had one or more compiler warnings.
  Generally, you'll lose 15% of the points for failure to follow instructions. 
  Since the compiler tells you what is wrong, there is <b>absolutely no excuse</b> 
  to ever submit a program that has any warnings whatsoever. (If you can't figure out the warning, 
  you should ask one of the many tutors or ask the instructor.) Of course, waiting until the last minute
  to do your homework may mean that no TAs are around.
<p>
<li><tt><b>NC</b></tt> No Compile - Similar to above except that you had a severe error that prohibited
  the compiler from performing its function. This is severe because, if your program doesn't compile,
  it surely won't run and produce any output, which will cause you to lose a significant amount of points,
  (and likely receive a 0).
<p>
-->
<tt><b></b></tt>

<li><tt><b>CW</b></tt> - Compiler warnings. This is no longer necessary since programs that won't
  compile cleanly will be rejected by the submission server.</li>
<p>
<li><tt><b>NC</b></tt> - No Compile (error). This is no longer necessary since programs that won't
  compile will be rejected by the submission server.</li>
<p>

<li><tt><b>OUT</b></tt> Output - Your output did not match the expected output. If you only had
  a very minor discrepency, you may lose as few as one point. If you had no output or all of it was
  incorrect, you may lose all of the points. A diff tool is always used to verify the output.
<p>
<li><tt><b>LEAK</b></tt> - There are memory leaks as reported by Valgrind or Dr. Memory</li>
<p>

<li><tt><b>FHC</b></tt> File Header Comment - Each program file <b>must</b> include a file header that 
  includes the information specified. This is an example of a file header from CS120. All lines are required:
<blockquote><pre>
/*****************************************************************************

due date    9/19/2026

Brief Description:
  This program calculates the distance to the moon using only a compass
  and a straight-edge. Functions include:
  - Distance
  - Calculate
  - Convert
  - Convolve
  - Contort

*****************************************************************************/

  - Distance
  - Calculate
  - Convert
  - Convolve

*/
/****************************************************************************/

</pre></blockquote>

<li><tt><b>FNH</b></tt> Function Header Comment - Each function must have a comment describing its purpose,
  return values (if any), and any input/output parameters. Here's an example from CS120. 
  All lines are required:
   
<blockquote><pre>
/*****************************************************************************
   Function: EDetect
   
Description: Transforms a bitmap picture by darkening the edges that
             were detected by the edge-detect algorithm.

     Inputs: picture    - A pointer to the image that will be transformed.
             resolution - The degree to which the transformation will occur.

    Outputs: The number of processor cycles required by the algorithm.
*****************************************************************************/

Doxygenized version:

/*!
  \brief

    the edge-detect algorithm.

  \param picture
    A pointer to the image that will be transformed. 
      
  \param resolution
    The degree to which the transformation will occur.

  \return
    The number of processor cycles required by the algorithm.

<p>
<li><tt><b>CRASH</b></tt> -  The program crashed. This may or may not be easily
detectable, depending on the nature of the crash.</li>
<p>
<li><tt><b>HANG</b></tt> -  The program hung. This is no longer necessary as
the Watchdog timer terminates a hung or inefficient program. Points are deducted
from the test that caused the hang.</li>
<p>
<li><tt><b>ID</b></tt> Internal Documentation - Essentially, these are comments in the code. 
  All code is required to have some documentation in the form of inline comments. Code that 
  has no comments or very few will lose points.
<p>
<li><tt><b>CQ</b></tt> Code Quality - This is simply a gauge of the quality of your code. 
  I posted a link to the
  <a class="pdf-icon" href="CodeQuality.pdf">Code Quality Guidelines</a>
  which list some of 
  these items. Not all will be applicable at this time. As we progress, more and more of these 
  should concern you.
<p>
<!--
<li><tt><b>FN</b></tt> File Naming - It is imperative that you follow the guidelines <i>exactly</i> 
  when naming your files. The assignment handout describes how to name the programming files. 
  Examples: (assume you're submitting programming assignment #2 and the C++ 
  file is supposed to be named <b>mileage.cpp</b>)<p>
<blockquote>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5>
<tr><th>Correct</th><th>Incorrect</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
  <pre>mileage.cpp</pre>
</td>
<td>
  <pre>Mileage.cpp<br>mileage.CPP<br>MILEAGE.cpp<br>assignment2.cpp</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>   
</blockquote>
<p>
-->

<!--
<li><tt><b>HC</b></tt> Hard Copy - This is the print out that you will submit. Exactly what needs to be printed out
  is listed in the handout for each assignment. Not all files that you submit electronically (in the .zip file) will
  need to printed out. Things that relate to the hard copy:
  <ul>
  <li>No word wrapping or line truncation. Make sure that your lines are short enough so that the printer doesn't
    automatically truncate the line or break the line in two. C/C++ is a free form language so you can manually
    break the lines anywhere (with a few exceptions). Another thing that can cause your lines not to print
    out the way they look on the screen is the margin settings. If you have wide left and right margins setup
    for printing, you will get significantly less characters printed per line.
  <li>The font size should be between 7 and 10 points. This will usually ensure that your lines won't be wrapped
    or broken by the printer. 
  <li>The font <b>must</b> be a fixed-pitch font (e.g. Courier New). No variable-pitch font (e.g. Arial or Times Roman).
</ul>
-->
<p>
<li><tt><b>DW</b></tt> Doxygen Warnings - Doxygen may emit warnings just like the compiler does. 
  You must not have any Doxygen warnings.

<p>
<li><tt><b>MEMBUGS</b></tt> Dr. Memory or Valgrind problems - These tools detect problems with your code at 
  runtime. These can include things overwriting the end of an array or trying to free memory using free
  when the memory was allocated with new. These deductions
  are separate from memory leak deductions listed above.
<p>
<li><tt><b>EC</b></tt> - Extra Credit. Some assignments have extra credit tests.</li>
<p>





</ul>

<!--

<p>
The distribution of points varies between assignments. For example, an assignment might have this distribution:

<ul>
<li><tt><b>CW/NC</b></tt> 15 points (Not compiling will likely earn 0 points.)
<li><tt><b>OUT</b></tt> 35 points
<li><tt><b>FH</b></tt> 10 points
<li><tt><b>FNH</b></tt> 10 points
<li><tt><b>ID</b></tt> 10 points
<li><tt><b>CQ</b></tt> 10 points
<li><tt><b>DW</b></tt> 10 points

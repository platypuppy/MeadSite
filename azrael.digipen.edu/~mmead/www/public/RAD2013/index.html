<p>

Just as no one would think of creating a modern, sophisticated game without the appropriate software development 
kits (SDK) for sound, graphics, input, physics, etc., most experienced software professionals tend to use development 
tools to create sophisticated desktop applications. It doesn't make any sense to waste time creating a framework 
for user interface components because several ready-to-use frameworks already exist for numerous languages and 
environments. 
<p>
For C++ on the Windows platform, the state-of-the-art in user interface development comes from a 
company called <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/">Embarcadero</a> (originally CodeGear, which was part of Borland) and the tool is called RAD Studio. (RAD is an acronym for <font color="blue"><b>R</b></font>apid 
<font color="blue"><b>A</b></font>pplication <font color="blue"><b>D</b></font>evelopment.) RAD Studio primarily supports two programming languages: C++ and Delphi. (Delphi is a powerful 
object-oriented Pascal language that rivals C++ and C# in its power and ease of use.) Fortunately, there is a free version of the tool, albeit, a little bit old now called Turbo C++.
It has most of the functionality of the professional tool, but is a few years older now, so it doesn't support some things 
(e.g. Windows 7 themes, touch interfaces) as easily as the commercial version. The latest version now can be used to easily develop
for Windows, Mac OS X, and iOS (iPhone apps), and soon, Linux and Android.
<p>
The free Turbo versions of RAD Studio only support a single language. The C++ version is called Turbo C++. 
For the most part, the free version is very similar to the commercial version and includes a full-blown, 
modern and powerful IDE. There are only very slight limitations with the free version of the IDE.
<p>
The subset of RAD Studio supporting C++ is called C++ Builder. Read about it at
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2BBuilder">C++ Builder on Wikipedia</a>.

<li><b>Who</b>
</td>
<td>
Prof. Mead will be giving the talks to interested students. The pre-requisites for this class are:
<ol>
  <li>CS 180, CS 225 and CS 280 as there's lots of inheritance in the framework and I want serious students with a good amount of 
  	programming skills (and I'm not going to explain these concepts during the class). There's also some
  	inter-process communication and threading.
  <li>The ability to meet twice a week for about 90 minutes (this is somewhat flexible)
  <li>The desire to learn to design user interfaces and to develop professional looking GUI applications. 
  	(This is a must, as I'm only doing this for students that are interested and, as always,
  	I will put my own time into it for my students.)
</ol>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>  
<li><b>What</b>
</td>
<td>
I will be presenting a series of demonstrations on building GUI applications in Windows using 
<a href="http://www.turboexplorer.com/cpp">Turbo C++ Explorer</a>, a <b>R</b>apid <b>A</b>pplication
<b>D</b>evelopment tool from <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/">Embarcadero</a>. (Embarcadero bought CodeGear which was the developer tools division of Borland Software.)
Turbo C++ is a lighter version of Embarcadero's flagship <a href="http://www.Embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio">RAD Studio</a>. RAD Studio contains support for
three programming languages: C++, Delphi, and Delphi.NET. (It used to support C#, as well.) 
<p class="technote">
Digipen has an older version of RAD Studio (2010, but newer than Turbo C++) installed on the computers in Einstein, I believe. Almost everything that I will
cover can be done with pretty much any version. So if those are all you have access to, you should be fine. Turbo C++ is installed on all Digipen computers.

<tr valign="top">
<td>
<li><b>When</b>
</td>

Mondays at 1:45 pm, Wednesdays at 2:00 pm. The session will last about 90 minutes and will go (tentatively) from 
Monday, May 13 through Wednesday, June 19.

</td>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
<li><b>Why</b>
</td>
<td>
Why not? Actually, there are many reasons but the common reason that students want to learn this tool is because it will
allow them to quickly develop powerful and professional GUI tools for their projects. I used to give a small, 2 hour session
on a similar tool several years ago. You can read about that session's purpose <a href="../../BorlandCBuilder.html">here</a>. Keep
in mind that a lot of the information in that post is outdated. However, the theory behind the session is still pretty relevant
to the lecture series I'm proposing this summer.

You most likely won't be able to download the files you need to install Turbo C++ as they no longer distribute it. However, you can download a local copy here:
	<ol>
		<li><a href="https://faculty.digipen.edu/~mmead/www/Files/Borland/Turbo2006.iso">Turbo C++ 2006</a>. 
			This is a CD image (about 650 MB) that should contain everything	you need. (MD5: <tt>a13fd595f7367e22d05be3e8bcf9b58c</tt>)
	
	<p>		
	You'll need a free key to use to IDE. 
	(If you are just using the command line compiler, you don't need a key.)
	You won't be able to get one online, so use this one: <a href="https://faculty.digipen.edu/~mmead/www/Files/Borland/reg740.txt">reg740.txt</a>.

If you think you want to just go straight to the latest version, you can get a 30-day 
<a href="https://downloads.embarcadero.com/free/rad_studio">free trial of RAD Studio XE 4</a> from their webiste. Be warned, though, that once you
experience a <b><i>true Visual C++ rapid application development tool</i></b>, you'll never be able to use anything else!


<blockquote>
<p class="technote">
It doesn't really matter too much which version you use as long as you use one of them. Like all software implementation (read: programming) classes, you're
only really going to understand the details if you actually practice. You are more than welcome to just sit in the sessions and watch along, but, if 
you really want to learn how to develop applications, you will need to work with all of the examples that I post. (And there will be many.)

These PDF documents will give you a good background on using the tool. They were written for an older version of the IDE
called <i>Borland C++ Builder 6</i>. Most of the information is relevant to the new Turbo C++ tool. However, some of the
screen shots will look different, since the new IDE has changed somewhat from the older one.

<a href="http://delphi.wikia.com/wiki/Delphi_Videos">Nick Hodge's Demos</a> He used to be a product manager at Codegear and
has made 30 (Flash) videos demonstrating how to use the Turbo development tools. (He's also the guy who 
helped me get Digipen the unlimited license key for the software.) 
Most of the videos discuss the Delphi programming
language, and you may or may not be interested in those. A good one to watch first is the 
<a href="http://blogs.embarcadero.com/nickhodges/2006/08/15/26688">Intro to the IDE</a> 
	This gives an overview of the major parts of the IDE. There are also a few videos that demonstrate how to create a text editor.
	(It's very similar to the demonstration I gave.) One thing to note about these videos is that Nick is using Turbo Delphi. The IDE
	is identical to Turbo C++, but the language is different. You should still be able to follow the presentations without much
	difficulty.
<p>

There used to be a great site called BCBDEV.com, which closed down a few years ago. However, the entire website (mostly code examples and FAQs) can 
be downloaded <a href="https://faculty.digipen.edu/~mmead/www/Files/Borland/bcbDevFaqs.zip">from this zip file</a>.  (There's an archive <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040201231408/http://bcbdev.com/faqs.htm">here</a>)
It's a good thing to have and to browse through. There are topics and links on
using <a href="../Files/borland_and_microsoft_dll.pdf">Visual C++ DLLs</a> with Borland's tools, <a href="http://dn.codegear.com/article/10528">OpenGL</a>, etc. The articles are older and refer to C++ Builder, 
but I suspect that most, if not all, of the information will still be relevant to the current tools.

<li><a href="http://bcbjournal.org/">BCB Journal</a> This was big back in the day when C++ Builder came from Borland. The magazine was very "thin"

	(Microsoft Systems Journal) from the late 80's and early 90's.
	It's now web-based only. The archives go back to 1997 and most of the

Weekly Sessions

<p class="technote">
These projects were originally developed with the free Turbo C++ version, and most worked with the latest
version of RAD Studio (XE 3 at the time). I have updated (almost) all of the projects to XE 3 and included
download links for them. You have the choice of downloading the Turbo C++ version or the XE 3 version. A few
projects could not be upgrade (older components) and a couple of projects only work with the newer versions
(they use 3rd party components.) I haven't tested with XE 4, but I'm pretty sure that the changes from XE 3
to XE 4 were very minor.

Additional Information: Project Settings
</p>
<p>
By default, C++ Builder builds applications to use runtime libraries (RTL) and packages. This keeps the size of the executables
smaller, but requires the users to have additional files installed on their computers. (Not generally a good idea in Windows.)

Since most people don't have 
C++ Builder installed on their computers, they won't be able to run the executables without these additional dependencies.
The preferred way to build applications is statically, so that all necessary components and libraries are included in
the executable. It will make the executable larger, but that's no longer an issue these days. To build static executables,
you have to change two settings in the project options. From the menu in the IDE, go to <b>Project | Options...</b> or
press Ctrl-Shift-F11 to open the Project Options dialog box. You may want to collapse the "C++ Compiler (bcc32)" options, as
it takes up all of the dialog box's list space.

Yes, it's larger, but it will work on any computer now.

	To install Clang version 8.x, you need to run these commands:
<blockquote><pre>
sudo apt-get install clang
sudo apt-add-repository "deb http://llvm.org/apt/<b>bionic</b>/ llvm-toolchain-<b>bionic</b>-8 main"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install clang-8

</pre></blockquote>
The repository is for Mint 19.x distros. Mint 19.x is based on Ubuntu Bionic, that's what the <b>bionic</b>
means.  If you are using some other version, you may have to change that to something else.
See <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/download_all.php">this</a> to determine what to put there.
Also, if you want a different version of Clang, you'll need to change the "8" in the lines
above to the correct value. See <a href="https://apt.llvm.org/">this</a> for examples.
<p>
To switch between versions, run this command:
<blockquote><pre>
sudo update-alternatives --config clang

Then run:

		Here is a simpler leak program: <a href="../../../../docs/membugs.cpp">membugs.cpp</a>

If you need more help with Valgrind that was demonstrated in class, look

information about using Dr. Memory with Windows.
<p>

<!--

		<p>
 	<li><a href="http://www.drmemory.org/">Dr. Memory</a> A cross-platform (Linux/Mac/Windows) memory 
 		debugger
 		much like Valgrind. It was developed at Google. It works best on 32-bit programs. You'll
 		need to install the 32-bit libraries on your 64-bit Linux system for C and C++:
-->
<li>If you need to build 32-bit programs, you'll need to install these files for gcc:
<blockquote><pre>
sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib g++-multilib
</pre></blockquote>
</li>
<p>


<li><a href="http://www.doxygen.nl/">Doxygen</a> - is a free, cross-platform, 
	automated documentation generator. The version that comes with Linux Mint 19.2 is
	1.8.13, and that's the version we'll be using. Simply install it like this:
<blockquote><pre>
sudo apt-get install doxygen
</pre></blockquote>
<!--
	 You should install version 1.8.16, which is what is installed
	at Digipen. You can get it here: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/doxygen/files/rel-1.8.16/doxygen-1.8.16.linux.bin.tar.gz/download">
  Doxygen 1.8.16</a>.
  <p>
  Just extract it into the <b><tt>/opt</tt></b> directory and then put a shortcut in the <tt>bin</tt>
  directory in your home directory:
<blockquote><pre>
ln -s /opt/doxygen-1.8.16/bin/doxygen $HOME/bin/doxygen
</pre></blockquote>
-->


  Here are the commands that you will need to run on your homework (and put in your <tt>makefile</tt>)

<blockquote><pre>
( cat Doxyfile ; echo "EXTRACT_ALL=YES" ) | doxygen -
( cat Doxyfile ; echo "EXTRACT_ALL=NO" ) | doxygen -
</pre></blockquote>

You'll need to modify this <a href="Doxyfile.txt">configuration file</a> for each assignment. You'll also
need to remove the file extension.


<p>
	You will also need to create a PDF file from the Doxygen-generate files.
	This will require a few other programs to be installed, which is trivial to do under Linux. You should
	install these:
<blockquote><pre>
sudo apt-get install doxygen-latex evince
</pre></blockquote>
<!--
	<blockquote><pre>
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-extra texlive-font-utils texlive-fonts-recommended evince
</pre></blockquote>
-->

If any other dependencies are required, simply install those as well. If you want the full
<sub><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\textbf {\LaTeX{}}"/></sub>
	experience, install the full version:
	<blockquote><pre>
sudo apt-get install texlive-full</pre></blockquote>
Realize that this could install over 3 GBs of files. There's also a nice editor/IDE for creating documents
called <a href="http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/">Texmaker</a> that works on Linux, Windows, and Mac.
I use that to create all of the quizzes and exams. Latex is one of the industry-standard tools for creating
high-quality technical documents, so learning the basics will give you skills outside of just
creating documentation for your code in CS180.
<p>

Here is a <a href="../../../../docs/sample1.tex.txt">sample1.tex</a> file to check your full installation.
(Remove the <tt>.txt</tt> extension to use the file.) The sample has chemistry diagrams and musical notation,
so you'll have to at least install these other packages (if you didn't do a full install):
<blockquote><pre>
sudo apt-get install texlive-science texlive-music abcm2ps ps2eps
</pre></blockquote>
<p>

Then run this command to produce a PDF:
<blockquote><pre>
pdflatex -shell-escape sample1.tex
</pre></blockquote>

<li>To create a bootable Linux Mint installer USB drive, use
	<a href="https://unetbootin.github.io/">unetbootin</a>. Download the version
	for your host (most likely Windows). It's pretty straight-forward, and the 
	website shows you how to use it. If you already have downloaded the .iso
	file, you can just choose to use it. If not, it will download it for you.
	However, if version 18.3 is not available, then you will have to download
	it manually.

<li>Download all files for a Mead assignment with this
	<a href="../../../CS180/fetch.html">bash script</a>. It's a work-in-progress, but it should

<a href="http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major">Overview of the major Linux distributions</a> -  
This page shows the Top Ten Linux Distributions.
We will be spending some time studying Linux, and this will give you a good idea of why I chose the 
distributions I did. There are over 100 different "versions" of Linux, and this gives you some insight 
into why Linux has so many choices (and why it is used more than any other operating system). Be 
prepared to answer the question, "Besides Mint, which of these distributions do you think you would 
use and why?"
<p>
Check out this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVpbFMhOAwE">short video</a> to see just 
how popular Linux is. It's a few years old, so the numbers will be much higher than are 
stated.</li> If you're new to Linux and interested in customizing the Cinnamon interface, here is 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v7fnMfFdrI">an introductory video</a> to do that. The guy that
did the video has lots of other related videos that you might find useful to watch. You can also search 
for "Linux Mint" on youtube for lots of others.
<p>
Read sections 1.1 through 1.8 in the <a class="pdf-icon" href="../../../../docs/VirtualBox-UserManual_5.0.0.pdf">PDF</a> 
that comes with Virtual Box. This is for version 5.0.0. Digipen may be using a different version, 
but the documentation 
should be almost identical. You can also read the latest documentation 
<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/UserManual.html">online</a>.
<p>
To get a decent overview of what Linux is compared to Windows, read the 
<a href="http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/ultimate-linux-guide-for-windows-users.html">Ultimate Linux Guide for Windows Users</a>. 
This should help you get started with the whole "Linux" thing.

<tr><td>
Install Linux Mint, either natively or via a virtual machine. The recommended version for this class 
is version 19.2. Any version from 18.0 to 19.2 (18.0, 18.1, 18.2, 19.0, 19.1, 19.2) should probably 
work, since we are going to replace the versions of GCC and Clang.

Unless you are having a 
problem with 19.2, you should install that one. It's called 
<font color="blue">
<i><a href="https://linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=267">Linux Mint 19.2 "Tina" - Cinnamon (64-bit)</a></i></font>

(Mint is the distribution, 19.2 is the version, and Cinnamon is the desktop envrionment.) You can add the other desktops 
(MATE, Xfce, etc.) afterwards. Version 19.2 comes with the correct compiler version (Clang 8.x) that we are
going to be using for all programming assignments. We will also be using version 8.x of the GNU gcc
compiler. Instructions on upgrading the version that comes with Mint is
<a href="../../../../mg/update-compilers/index.html#UPDATE2">here</a>. You can just run the install script (install-gcc-all.sh)
that is near the end of the page.
<p>
Read 	<a class="pdf-icon" href="../../../../public/linux/linuxmint18-UserManual.pdf">Linux Mint User's Manual</a> - 
It's for version 18, but it's mostly the same as 19.
You can skip the installation instructions if you want as I've already demonstrated and given you
a written tutorial on installation. Start reading at page 21, and then read about packages
starting on page 35. This will give you lots of information to get you up to speed quickly.


<p>
Read chapters 1 through 7 in <a class="pdf-icon" href="../../../../docs/TheLinuxCommandLine.pdf">The Linux Command Line</a>. 
You should read this while sitting at the computer and running Linux. Also, you should realize that, 
although the command line in Linux may look a lot like the command line in Windows, the Linux command line 
(the Bash shell) is infinitely more powerful than the one in Windows. You will do well for yourself to 
explore at least the basics of it. Those of you that have been using Linux or Mac OS X from the command
line may only need to skim this information.

<p>
Take a few of your programming assignments/labs from CS120/CS170 (e.g. spellcheck, List, Vector,
you'll need the Linux dictionary for the spellchecker), 
build and execute them in Linux. 
They should all compile and run the same as they did on Windows. Note: To execute a program under 
Linux, you must prefix the command with <tt>./</tt> (that's a dot and forward slash, which 
indicates the current directory).

The first personal computer that I worked on was my dad's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_series">Apple II</a>.
The first personal computer that
I owned was the Sanyo MBC550. I had a love/hate relationship with that thing. It came with a whopping
128K of RAM but I "upgraded" it by adding an additional 128K (256K total) for about $50 (circa 1986). 
I bought the RAM from some electronics store. I didn't even know how I was going to put it in the 
computer. I needed that much RAM because I was trying to do some graphics stuff (no color, of course) 
in 640x200 mode, which was too much resolution for only 128K of RAM. You can read about
this computer <a href="http://www.seasip.info/VintagePC/sanyo.html">here</a>
and <a href="http://www.digibarn.com/collections/systems/sanyo/index.html">here</a>.

<li><a href="http://www.pacifier.com/~mmead/router">How to build a custom router</a> This is 
	a "documentary" that I wrote on how to build your own router. Most people use a consumer-grade router 
	by Linksys or Cisco or DLink or something like that. When you out-grow those routers, you need 
	something more powerful. Follow the link and I'll show you how. (Lots of pictures!)</li>

<li><a href="http://www.fit-pc.com/web/fit-pc/intensepc/">New server</a> It has 16 GBs of RAM, a 1 TB 2.5" 
	hard drive, dual 10/100/1000 Mb network ports and
is running Linux Mint 13 64-bit LTS. That's overkill for a supposedly "dedicated server", but I have
much more planned for this bad boy. I also recently set up a 
<a href="http://global.shuttle.com/news/productsSpec?productId=1767">new Linux server</a>
to experiment with. I now have 4 of these puppies running.

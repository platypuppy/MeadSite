Usually, you are give one week to implement each of the labs. This lab can easily be
done in one week, but I'm giving you two weeks to implement it. The reason is because
we will have another week off from school (Spring Break) and some of you may want to use that time
to get caught up in all of your work. On Friday, March 15, 2019, I will give out the
second Vector lab, which you will also have two weeks to complete. It doesn't require
two weeks to complete either, but since Spring Break is the following week, some of
you may want to use that time to do all of the work.
<br><br>
<b>Bottom line:</b> There is plenty of time to implement both of these labs. I'm just
letting you choose if you want to complete them over Spring Break, or do them during
the "normal" semester weeks. The choice is yours.
</p>

<p class="SectionHeader">
Information
</p>

For the next few labs we will be implementing a different class. The class is <b><tt>Vector</tt></b> 
and will be similar to the <b><tt>std::vector</tt></b> that is in the STL. Just as with the 
linked list labs, all of the labs will build off of each other so you'll have to complete 
all of them. Near the end of the semester, you will submit all of the code as an assignment,
just like you did with the <b><tt>List</tt></b> lab.

<p class="technote">
At its most basic level, the Vector class is simply a wrapper around a dynamically-allocated
array. (Much like how the <tt>std::string</tt> class is a wrapper around a NUL-terminated
character array.) The Vector class shields the user from dealing with the allocations and
deallocations of memory. It provides many conveniences that a built-in array doesn't provide,
such as bounds-checked access and automatic resizing.
<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> This is NOT a templated class like the vector class from the STL.
</p>

<hr width="95%">

<ol>
<li>In this lab, you will be creating a <tt>Vector</tt> class, similar to the one in the 
	Standard Template Library. You won't be providing any iterator classes, as that is beyond 
	the scope of CS170. There is only one non-trivial method that you need to implement 
	for this lab.
<p>
<ul>
<li>You are given the header file <a  href="Vector.h">Vector.h</a> (<a href="Vector.h.html">HTML</a>) 
to start with, and a partial implementation in <a href="Vector.cpp">Vector.cpp</a> 
(<a href="Vector.cpp.html">HTML</a>) 
to help get you started. There are 11 public methods so far, and 9 of them are trivial. 
(I've implemented 6 of them for you.)
The ones
in <font color="blue">blue</font> have already been implemented for you.
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNB_RjpWnsI">You're welcome!</a>).
<ol>
	<p>
	<li><font color="blue">Default constructor</font></li>
	<li>Destructor</li>
	<li>clear</li>
	<li>operator[] (non-const)</li>
	<li>operator[] (const)</li>
	<li><font color="blue">empty</font></li>
	<li><font color="blue">size</font></li>
	<li><font color="blue">capacity</font></li>
	<li><font color="blue">allocations</font></li>
</ol>	
<p>
You'll need about 10 lines of code (total) to implement the remaining 4 functions above.
The remaining 2 public methods are a little more involved:
	<p>
<ol>
	<li><b>push_front</b> - You need to shift all elements over one position. If the array
	is full, you must grow it first.</li>
		<p>
	<li><b>push_back</b> - No shifting, but if the array is full, you will need to grow the array first.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<li>Your task is to implement all of the methods that are defined in the header file. There are 
	some private fields already defined, and you shouldn't need any others. There are also some 
	simple methods already implemented.</li>
<p>
<li>Start with the <b><tt>push_back</tt></b> method and try to pass the first test. Once you 
	get <b><tt>push_back</tt></b> working, the rest will come pretty quickly.</li>
<p>
<li>Probably, the most difficult method at this point is the private <b><tt>grow</tt></b> method. 
	<b><tt>push_back</tt></b> calls this method, so you will need to implement it to get 
	<b><tt>push_back</tt></b> to work.</li>
	<p>
<li>Growing a vector/array simply means allocating another array that is <b>twice</b> 
	the size of the original array, copying the elements from the orginal array into the new 
	array, and then deleting the original array.</li>
	<p>
<li>The subscript operators should call <i>check_bounds</i> before returning the item.
	The reason you aren't checking in the subscript operator is code-reuse. There will be
	several other places you'll need to check the bounds and you don't want to duplicate this
	code every where. This is especially important when we change the behavior of the <i>check_bounds</i>
	function: You don't want to change it in mulitple places.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Growing a vector:</b> (<font color="blue">Requires about 10 lines of code.</font>)
<ol>
<li>Original vector:
<blockquote>
<img src="Vector-grow-1.jpg">
</blockquote>

<li>After growing (allocate another array that is twice as large):
<blockquote>
<img src="Vector-grow-2.jpg">
</blockquote>

<li>Copy existing elements from original array into new array <i>using a loop of some kind</i>. 
	Do not use <b><tt>memcpy</tt></b> or anything like that. If you don't understand why
	that is, then you <b>DEFINITELY</b> should not use it!
<blockquote>
<img src="Vector-grow-4.jpg">
</blockquote>

<li><b>Don't forget: Free the memory from the original array or you'll have a memory leak.</b></li>
</ol>
<p><br><br>
<b>Pushing to the front: Example: <tt>push_front(2);</tt></b>
<ol>
<li>Original vector:
<blockquote>
<img src="Vector-push_front-1.jpg">
</blockquote>

<li>Copy all elements to the right one slot starting with the <b>right-most element first</b>:
<blockquote>
<img src="Vector-push_front-2.jpg">
</blockquote>

<li>Put the value in the open slot:
<blockquote>
<img src="Vector-push_front-3.jpg">
</blockquote>
	
<li>Make sure there is enough room in the array before shifting all of the elements. 
	You may have to grow the array first.
	<p>
	<b>Hint:</b> You might want to make a private helper function that shifts elements.
	This will make <tt>push_front</tt> (and other methods to come) simpler.
</ol>

<p>
<hr width="100%">
<p>

<li>Add Doxygen comments to <tt><b>Vector.h</b></tt> and <tt><b>Vector.cpp</b></tt>. 
	Make a bullet list of the functions in the .cpp file. Create doxygen function header comments 
	for each function.

Here is some test code in <a href="driver.cpp">driver.cpp</a> (<a href="driver.cpp.html">HTML</a>). 
Command lines:
<p>
GNU g++:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>g++</b> -o gnu -O2 -Wconversion -Wall -Wextra -Werror -ansi -pedantic driver.cpp Vector.cpp
</pre></blockquote>

<blockquote><pre>

<!--<b>clang++</b> -o clan -O2 -Wconversion -Wall -Wextra -Werror -ansi -pedantic driver.cpp Vector.cpp<br>
Microsoft (Optional for use with Dr. Memory)
<b>cl</b> /W4 /WX /Zi /MT /EHsc /Oy- /Ob0 /Fems.exe driver.cpp Vector.cpp
-->

To run a single test, provide the number on the command line. Example:

<blockquote><pre>
gnu 5
</blockquote>

will run test #5 (calls the TestALot1 function). If you don't provide any number, all tests 
will be run.

<blockquote>
<a href="output-all.txt">Output from all functions</a>
</blockquote>

Don't forget to add <tt>--strip-trailing-cr</tt> to the <tt>diff</tt> program to ignore 
the newlines between GNU's output and the other compilers.

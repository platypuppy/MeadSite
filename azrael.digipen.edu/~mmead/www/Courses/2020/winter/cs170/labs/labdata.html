<b>IMPORTANT:</b>



<ol>
	<li>DO NOT USE INTERNET EXPLORER IN THIS CLASS. (Unless instructed to do so. Even then, 
		question it!)</li>
	<p>
	<li>When downloading files for the lab DO NOT save the web page, save the file.
		To save the file with Firefox, right-click on the link and choose "Save Link As..."
		This is so that all of the formatting in the file is preserved.</li>
	<p>
	<li>Don't forget that you may need to use the <b><tt>--strip-trailing-cr</tt></b> 
		switch with <tt>diff</tt>
		if it's telling you that all of the lines are different.</li>
	<p>

	<li><a href="https://pontus.digipen.edu/cgi-bin/submission.cgi">Online submission page</a> for 
		the labs. Your username and password are the same as your Digipen login.
    If you are only submitting a single file, you can just upload that file. However, if you
    are submitting multiple files, you <b>MUST</b> zip them up into a .zip file. Be sure to <b>ONLY</b>
    include the files that have been requesting. Do not include any directories in your zip file
    (only files).
<!--
<p class="technote">
		You will normally have until <b>10:00 pm on Monday evening</b>
		to submit the lab, <b>unless otherwise stated on the lab web page</b>.
</p></li>
-->
		<!--
-->
<p>

<li>Make sure that you save all of your code for the labs. Most of the labs are going to build on previous
        labs. This means that, unlike CS120, <b>you must do every lab</b>. Also, you will be submitting 
        all of the code at various times during the semester for the TAs to grade as if it were
        a programming assignment.</li>


<p class="technote">
	All code for the labs <b>MUST</b> still follow the 
	<a href="../../../../../docs/CS120StyleGuide.pdf">Style Guide for CS120</a>. The
	<b>tablen</b> program must be run on your files, as well.
</p>



<!--
<p class="technote">
		When the server accepts your submission, your score will be 10/10. However, the TAs
		will then evaluate your code to ensure you are following the Style Guide. If any deficiencies
		are found, your grade will be lowered.
</p></li>
-->

<li>In order to help automate the testing of your code, the submission server will use input/output
redirection. If you understand this simple concept, it will help you automate your own testing.
<p>
Normally, output (e.g. <tt><b>cout</b></tt>) sends its output to the screen. To send it
to a file instead, use the greater-than (&gt;) symbol:

<blockquote><pre>
myprogram &gt; out.txt
</blockquote>

Any output from <i>myprogram</i> will go to a file named <i>out.txt</i> and you will see nothing on
the screen. 
<p>
Normally, input (e.g. <tt><b>cin</b></tt>) is read from the keyboard. To have the program read input
from a file instead, use the less-than (&lt;) symbol:

<blockquote><pre>
myprogram &lt; in.txt
</blockquote>

All input to <i>myprogram</i> is read from <i>in.txt</i>, and the keyboard is ignored. Also, none of the 
characters that are in the file will show on the screen.
</li>
<p>
<li>Here is a <a href="../Doxyfile-1.8.15.txt">Doxygen template</a> (rename it to just Doxyfile)
	to use for the labs and assignments. 
	You must edit this file for each lab/assignment so that it contains the relevant information
	(e.g. filenames, assignment/lab name/numbers).</li>

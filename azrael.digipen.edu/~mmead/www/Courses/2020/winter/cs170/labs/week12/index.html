<p class="technote">
<b>Note:</b> 
You will be required to submit all of the functions that have been writing for the <i>Vector</i> 
class so far. There is a mega-driver at the bottom of this page that will be used to test all 
of your functions. This should be trivial for you to test since there are only two additional 
functions to write this week.  
Make sure your code is cleanly written and properly formatted per the style guidelines. You also 
need to make sure you have Doxygenized the code (file headers, function headers, etc.) 
just as if you were submitting a "regular" assignment. Again, since you were supposed to 
have done all of this in previous labs, this should only take you a short while to prepare. 
Of course, if you haven't been doing the required lab work, you may not have time to submit much.
<br><br>
This is basically "free points" for students that have been doing the required
homework this semester.
<p>


<p class="SectionHeader">
Information
</p>
<ol>
<li>You will continue to enhance the Vector class that you've been working on by adding 2 more 
  methods to the class. You will add a search method
	and a sort method as described below. The sort method sorts the data from smaller to larger.
	<p>
	
	Given this header file <a  href="Vector.h">Vector.h</a> (<a href="Vector.h.html">HTML</a>), 
  add the new methods of the Vector class. (The new methods are not in the header file yet.)



There are 2 new methods:
  
<blockquote><pre>
      <font color="#003399"><i>// Sorts the elements using a selection sort. </i></font>
      <font color="#003399"><i>// Returns the number of swaps/comparisons that occurred.</i></font>
      <font color="#003399"><i>// <b>Requires about 15 lines of code.</b></i></font>
    SortResult selection_sort();

      <font color="#003399"><i>// This searches the vector using a binary search instead</i></font>
      <font color="#003399"><i>// of a linear search. The data must be sorted. Returns</i></font>
      <font color="#003399"><i>// the index. If not found, returns CS170::Vector::NO_INDEX.</i></font>
      <font color="#003399"><i>// DO NOT SORT THE DATA IN THIS FUNCTION!!</i></font>
      <font color="#003399"><i>// <b>Requires about 12 lines of code.</b></i></font>
    <b>int</b> bsearch(<b>int</b> value) <b>const</b>;
</pre></blockquote>

and a structure used by the sort method:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>struct</b> SortResult
{
  <b>unsigned</b> compares; <font color="#003399"><i>// The number of comparisons done during the sort.</i></font>
  <b>unsigned</b> swaps;    <font color="#003399"><i>// The number of swaps done during the sort.</i></font>
};
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
You can not change the public interface for any class that is provided to you. For the
  the <tt><b>SubscriptError</b></tt> class, you cannot change anything, public or private.
<p>  
Here is some additional information on <a href="diagrams/Sorting.html">selection sort and binary search</a>.
<big><b>Please read this information before starting to write code.</b></big>

<p>

<li>Add Doxygen file headers and comments to <tt><b>Vector.h</b></tt> and 
  <tt><b>Vector.cpp</b></tt>. Make a bullet list of the functions in the .cpp file. Create doxygen 
  function header comments for each function. Most of this work was done for the last lab, so 
  this should only take a few minutes to update.

Output from all tests:
<blockquote>
<a href="output-all.txt">output-all.txt</a>

Don't forget to add <tt>--strip-trailing-cr</tt> to the <tt>diff</tt> program to ignore the 
newlines between GNU's
output and the other compilers. <!--You may want to use WinMerge to diff individual tests.-->
<p>
<p class="technote">
After you finish this lab, you can upload the files to the submission server to get credit for 
the lab. The next part will be uploaded as a different assignment, so you will not upload 
it with this lab.

Now that you have completed all of the necessary methods of the <tt>Vector</tt> class, you need 
to make sure that
you can pass the tests in this 
<a href="megadriver.cpp">megadriver.cpp</a> (<a href="megadriver.cpp.html">HTML</a>). 
After you successfully pass the tests, you will submit it like any
other assignment. This driver has 28 tests.
<p>

Output of all tests:
<blockquote>
<a href="output-mega.txt">Output</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Command lines: 

GNU g++:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>g++</b> -o gnu -O2 -Wconversion -Wall -Wextra -Werror -ansi -pedantic megadriver.cpp Vector.cpp PRNG.cpp

To run an individual test, provide the test number on the command line. For example, to 
run <i>TestBSearch1</i>, do this:

<blockquote><pre>
gnu 15
</pre></blockquote>

To run all tests, don't provide any number on the command line. See the <tt>main</tt> function 
in the driver to see
which number runs which test.
<p>

Don't forget to add <tt>--strip-trailing-cr</tt> to the <tt>diff</tt> program to ignore the 
newlines between GNU's
output and the other compilers.
<p>
</blockquote>


<p class="Warning">
After completing this final part, be sure to zip up your files 
(<tt>Vector.h and Vector.cpp</tt>)
and submit them to the appropriate submission page by the due date/time.
This assignment is called <tt>assign_vectorlab</tt> on the submission server.
Because this final part is an <i>assignment</i> rather than a <i>lab</i>, the
submission server is doing nothing but building your program. I will build it
on my computer and give the results to the TAs to grade. Afterwards, the 
results will be placed in your Returned folders.

<b>Somewhat advanced stuff:</b> (Maybe for after the semester or over the summer for those that
are curious.) Students that have taken CS180 should have little problem understanding the code.
<p>
  
For those of you that are interested in playing with the threaded version of the driver (Microsoft only), 
you would build it like this:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>cl</b> /O2 /EHa /W4 /WX /Femst.exe <font color="blue"><b>/MT /DWATCHDOG</b></font> megadriver.cpp Vector.cpp PRNG.cpp 
</pre></blockquote>

This will run each test in a background thread. The benefit of this is that if the test runs 
too long (infinite loop or other poorly written code), the test will be terminated after a while. 
This will prevent any test from going "crazy" and never completing. I use this technique in almost
all of my drivers for sophomore classes where it's very easy for students to implement code that 
takes too long to complete. 
<p>
To see how long each test is actually taking to run, set the default value for the 
<b><tt>announce_level</tt></b> in the <b><tt>ExecuteTest</tt></b>
function to 2:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>void</b> ExecuteTest(TestFn fn, <b>int</b> maxwait = 1000, <b>int</b> safewait = 1000, <b>int</b> announce_level <font color="red"><b>= 2</b></font>)
</pre></blockquote>

Now, when you run your code, the time to execute each test is displayed in the output. 
Please realize that the time is not very accurate using this method, but it is standard 
across computers. However, it's more than accurate enough for these tests. Study the 
driver for more information.

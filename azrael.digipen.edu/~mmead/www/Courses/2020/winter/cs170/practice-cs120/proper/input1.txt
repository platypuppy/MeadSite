ASSUME THAT A STUDENT IS TYPING HIS FINAL REPORT FOR ENGLISH CLASS
INTO A TEXT FILE. AFTER COMPLETING THE REPORT, HE REALIZED THAT
HE MISTAKENLY HAD THE CAPS LOCK KEY ON THROUGHOUT THE TYPING PROCESS. HE SAID
OH MY GOSH! WHAT HAVE I DONE? HOW AM I GOING TO FIX THIS? BUT THEN HE KNEW C.
SO HE SAID "I WILL WRITE ME A C PROGRAM".

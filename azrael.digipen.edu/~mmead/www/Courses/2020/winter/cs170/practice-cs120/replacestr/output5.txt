When in THE Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to
dissolve THE political bands which have connected THEm with anoTHEr, and to
assume among THE powers of THE earth, THE separate and equal station to
which THE Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle THEm, a decent respect
to THE opinions of mankind requires that THEy should declare THE causes
which impel THEm to THE separation.
We hold THEse truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,
that THEy are endowed by THEir Creator with certain unalienable Rights,
that among THEse are Life, Liberty and THE pursuit of Happiness. --That
to secure THEse rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving
THEir just powers from THE consent of THE governed, --That whenever any
Form of Government becomes destructive of THEse ends, it is THE Right of
THE People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government,
laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in
such form, as to THEm shall seem most likely to effect THEir Safety and
Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long
established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and
accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to
suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right THEmselves by
abolishing THE forms to which THEy are accustomed. But when a long train
of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably THE same Object evinces a
design to reduce THEm under absolute Despotism, it is THEir right, it is
THEir duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for
THEir future security.--Such has been THE patient sufferance of THEse
Colonies; and such is now THE necessity which constrains THEm to alter
THEir former Systems of Government. The history of THE present King of
Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all
having in direct object THE establishment of an absolute Tyranny over
THEse States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

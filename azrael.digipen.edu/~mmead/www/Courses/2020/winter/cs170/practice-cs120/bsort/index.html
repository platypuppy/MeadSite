<li>Write a function that will sort an array of integers. There are countless ways to do sorting,
  some are very easy to implement, some, not so easy. Since this is our first attempt at sorting,
  we're going to go the easy way. Simple sorting methods include selection sort, insertion sort,
  and exchange sort, also known as a bubble sort. All of these methods are similar in their 
  implementations and performance. 
<p>
  We're going to implement the bubble sort. Some of you have probably already seen this and maybe
  even know it's not a very good way to sort things. That may be, but we aren't interested in
  "the best" sort method at this point. (That time will come later...) I just want everyone to
  see this sort, so that when you compare it to others, you'll see and understand the differences.
  <p>
  A bubble sort works by comparing adjacent items 
  and exchanging (swapping) them if they are out of order. The meaning of "out of order" depends 
  on how you want the items sorted: smallest to largest, or largest to smallest. 
<p>

More details about the algorithm are <a href="bsort.html">here</a>. Basically, you will have
a nested <b><tt>for</tt></b> loop. You won't need more than 10 lines of code, and may be able to have less,
depending on how you do your logic.
<p>
This is the prototype for the function:
<blockquote><pre>
void bsort(<b>int</b> array[], <b>int</b> size);
</pre></blockquote>
You'll notice that the array is not marked with the <tt><b>const</b></tt> keyword. This is simply
because you are going to modify the array. 
You must sort the elements in-place. That's why it's not <tt><b>const</b></tt>.
This means that <b>you are not allowed to create another array.</b> 
<p>
The name of the file should be named <tt>bsort.c</tt> and the command to compile it will look like this:
<blockquote><pre>
gcc -Werror -Wall -Wextra -ansi -pedantic -O2 -o bsort main.c bsort.c PRNG.c
</pre></blockquote>

<b>Files:</b>

    <tt>main.c</tt>: <a href="main.c.html">HTML</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="main.c">Text</a></li>

  <li>Random number generator files (put these in the same directory as your C file)

  <li>This is probably the simplest practice program thus far. (You will need it
    for future assignments.)</li>

<p class="Trivia">
The bubble sort is called an <i>N<sup>2</sup></i> algorithm because the number of
    operations required on N items is <i>N<sup>2</sup></i>, in the worst case. Other <i>N<sup>2</sup></i>
    trivial sorting algorithms are selection sort and insertion sort. Both of those will typically run
    faster than a bubble sort. However, at this stage in your career, you are more worried about
    correctness than performance. In the Real World&trade; none of these sorting methods would
    be useable with large numbers of items. However, any of these algorithms provide a beginning
    programmer with a chance at creating a very simple sort function using the C programming
    language.
    You'll learn all about performance (worst-case asymptotic time complexity)
    of various algorithms and data structures in 
    CS280 (Data Structures) and in CS330 (Algorithm Analysis).

<ol>
<!-- ************************************************************************************************ -->
<!-- ************************************************************************************************ -->
<li>For this practice assignment, you will write two functions. The first function is called
  <i>encode</i> and its prototype is this:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>void</b> encode(FILE *infile, FILE *outfile);
</pre></blockquote>

The second function is called <i>decode</i> and this is the prototype:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>void</b> decode(FILE *infile, FILE *outfile);
</pre></blockquote>

Looking at the names of the functions, you can probably guess what they do. One function
<i>encodes</i> some file's data, and the other function <i>decodes</i> the data. There are no
return values from the functions. We will assume that if the files can be opened (by the driver),
then you should be able to encode/decode them successfully. 
<p>
The encoding/decoding algorithm that you are going to implement is a <i>lossless</i> data compression algorithm
known as the <i>RLE algorithm</i>, or 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding">Run-length encoding</a> algorithm. It's a 
simple algorithm that even beginning programmers can implement.
In a nutshell, a data compression 
algorithm (like those used to create <i>.zip</i> or <i>.rar</i> files) simply removes redundancy from
a file. This will generally make the file smaller (sometimes, much smaller) than the original file.
<p>
As an example, suppose that you had a file (<tt>A</tt>) that contained 100 characters and they were all
the letter 'A' (ASCII 65). That file would be 100 bytes in size and look like this:

<blockquote><pre>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
</pre></blockquote>

Looking at it with <i>dumpit</i>, it looks like this:

<blockquote><pre>
A:
       00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07  08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
000000 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41  41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
000010 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41  41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
000020 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41  41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
000030 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41  41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
000040 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41  41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
000050 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41  41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
000060 41 41 41 41                                        AAAA
</pre></blockquote>

However, because there are so many consecutive letters that are the same, we
can encode that information in fewer bytes. So, instead of writing 100 copies of 'A' to the file, we
will write one letter 'A', and then follow it with a count. The count is the actual number of letter
A's that were in the original file. So, our "encoded" file (<tt>A.rle</tt>) will have only two bytes in it (shown in hexadecimal):

<blockquote><pre>
41 64
</pre></blockquote>

Hex 41 is decimal 65 (the letter 'A') and hex 64 is decimal 100, the number of times to repeat the character.
Looking at the binary file with <i>dumpit</i>:
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
A.rle:
       00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07  08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
000000 41 64                                              Ad
</pre></blockquote>


That's a HUGE difference! The original file required 100 bytes on the disk, but the compressed file
only required 2 bytes! (<i>"Welcome to the wonderful world of data compression!"</i>)
<p>
Of course, at some point we will have to "decode" the file and expand it back to the original size and contents.
That's what the decode function will do. It will take as input a compressed file containing just those 2 bytes,
and create a new file that has 100 characters in it, all of them are the letter 'A':

<blockquote><pre>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
</pre></blockquote>
Pretty cool! Of course, if the file doesn't contain a lot of redundant data, the RLE algorithm will
actually make the file larger, up to twice the size. But, this can happen with other compression
algorithms, although to a lesser degree. As an example, suppose our file (<tt>ABCDE.txt</tt>) contains
just the letters <tt>ABCDE</tt> (5 bytes):
<p>

<blockquote><pre>
ABCDE.txt:
       00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07  08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
000000 41 42 43 44 45                                     ABCDE
</pre></blockquote>

Encoding this file to <tt>ABCDE.rle</tt> causes it to be twice as large (10 bytes):

<blockquote><pre>
ABCDE.rle:
       00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07  08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
000000 41 01 42 01 43 01 44 01  45 01                     A.B.C.D.E.
</pre></blockquote>

So, the more redundancy in the file, the better the compression. Again, this is true for all
compression algorithms.
<p>
  Here is a driver file: <a href="main.c.html">HTML</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <a href="main.c">Text</a>
<p>
The name of your implementation file should be <tt>encoder.c</tt> and the command to compile it will look like this:
<blockquote><pre>
gcc -O -Werror -Wall -Wextra -ansi -pedantic main.c encoder.c -o encoder
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
To run the program and encode a file named <tt>A300.txt</tt> into a file named <tt>A300.rle</tt>:

<blockquote><pre>
encoder A300.txt A300.rle
</pre></blockquote>

To decode the encoded file:
<blockquote><pre>
encoder -d A300.rle myA300.txt
</pre></blockquote>


<blockquote><pre>
</pre></blockquote>

Simple test files to get you started: <a href="files.zip">files.zip</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are two sets of files. Files starting with <tt><b>in</b></tt> are input files, and files starting
with <tt><b>out</b></tt> are the encoded output files. You'll see that for each input file, there is a 
corresponding encoded file. Start with the smaller ones first.
<p>
After you've successfully tested your code with the simple files above, try to encode these bigger
files:
<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10>
  <tr valign="top"><th>Input file</th><th>Output file<br>(encoded)</th><th>Hex output<br>(dumpit)</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="A300.txt">A300.txt</a></td><td><a href="A300.rle">A300.rle</a></td>
    <td><a href="A300-hex.txt">A300-hex.txt</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="icon1.bmp">icon1.bmp</a></td><td><a href="icon1.rle">icon1.rle</a></td>
    <td><a href="icon1-hex.txt">icon1-hex.txt</a></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><a href="smiley-bw.bmp">smiley-bw.bmp</a></td><td><a href="smiley-bw.rle">smiley-bw.rle</a></td>
    <td><a href="smiley-bw-hex.txt">smiley-bw-hex.txt</a></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><a href="black.bmp">black.bmp</a></td><td><a href="black.rle">black.rle</a></td>
    <td><a href="black-hex.txt">black-hex.txt</a></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><a href="dude.jpg">dude.jpg</a></td><td><a href="dude.rle">dude.rle</a></td>
    <td><a href="dude-hex.txt">dude-hex.txt</a></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
All of the big files in one zip: <a href="big-files.zip">big-files.zip</a>
<p>

<p class="SectionHeader">Notes</p>
<ol>
  <li>Both functions take two FILE pointers. The driver has already opened both of them and will close
    them. DO NOT close these files yourself. The first FILE pointer is opened for read/binary and the
    second FILE pointer is opened for write/binary.</li>
  <p>
  <li>The only header file that you need to include is <i>stdio.h</i>.
    <p>
  <li>Since the largest value that will fit into a character is 255 (0xFF), that's the most number of
    bytes that can be encoded at one time. So, if the letter 'A' appears 300 times consecutively, you
    will have to store 2 <i>chunks</i>. The first chunk  encodes the first 255 bytes, and the second 
    chunk encodes the remaining 45 bytes:

<blockquote><pre>
A300.rle:
       00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07  08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
000000 41 FF 41 2D                                        A.A-
</pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li>You should start with the very simple files before attempting to encode the very large ones. There
  is a .zip file that contains several simple test cases (<i>in</i> files) along with their corresponding
  encodings (<i>out</i> files).
</li>
<p>
<li>Because the encoded files (.rle) are binary files (not text files),
  you won't be able to use <i>diff</i> to compare your output with the expected output. You can
  use a program called <i>cmp</i> (from the Cygwin toolkit), which is meant for binary files. If the files are identical,
  <i>cmp</i> won't say anything. However, if they are different, you will see output that resembles
  this:
<blockquote><pre>
file1.rle file2.rle differ: byte 492, line 2
</pre></blockquote>
which isn't very helpful. See then next note.</li>
<p>

<li>You should use the <i>dumpit</i> program (or similiar) to see what your binary encoded files look
  like to help debug your implementation. 
  You can't use a text editor to view the encoded files because they are not text files. If you run
  <i>dumpit</i> on both encoded files (your file and the expected output file) and then run
  <i>diff</i> on those (or a visual diff tool like WinMerge or kdiff3), you'll get a better view
  of what is wrong. So, using the example from above, run these commands:

<blockquote><pre>
dumpit file1.rle > file1-hex.txt
dumpit file2.rle > file2-hex.txt
diff file1-hex.txt file2-hex.txt
</pre></blockquote>

and you will be able to see which bytes are different using <i>diff</i>. Hint: use a visual diff
tool.

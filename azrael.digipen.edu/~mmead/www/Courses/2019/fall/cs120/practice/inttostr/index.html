Information
</p>

<p class="technote">
Before writing any code, you should write down the steps (<b>in English</b> or your native language) 
you need to take to solve these problems. This is your <i>pseudocode</i>.
Once you have your pseudocode written, you can convert it into C code. If you can't write 
down the steps in English, you certainly can't write
it in C.
</p>

The function you'll be writing for this practice deals with NUL-terminated C-style strings.
The only header file you can include is <tt>string.h</tt>,
and you'll only need the <tt>strlen</tt> function.

<p>
<hr width="90%">
<p>

<p>
The function you will write converts an integer into a string. The name of the 
  function is <tt>inttostr</tt>
	(integer to string) and the prototype is:
	
<blockquote><pre>
<b>void</b> inttostr(<b>int</b> number, <b>char</b> string[]);
</pre></blockquote>

The <tt>string</tt> you are given is large enough to contain the largest integer (10 digits), including 
the negative sign and NUL terminator. 
<p>
<b>Hint</b>: Work on the positive numbers first before trying to deal with the negative numbers. 
You will use the mod operator, <tt>%</tt>, and the division operator, <tt>/</tt>, in a loop to 
extract the digits from the integer. (You've already seen this in other practices.)

For example, to extract the two digits from the integer
<tt>42</tt>:

<blockquote><pre>
42 / 10 ==> 4
42 % 10 ==> 2
</pre></blockquote>

For larger numbers, use modulo and division with larger powers of 10: 100, 1000, etc.
<p>
<!--
(You've already done this in a 
<a href="../week5/index.html">previous lab</a>.)
-->
Once you have the digit, convert it to a character (e.g. <tt>4 + '0' == '4'</tt>)
and put the character in the proper position in the string. 
Consult an <a href="../../../../../../docs/ASCII-binary-hex-chart.html">ASCII table</a> to see why this works.
<p>
You may find it easier to build the string backwards (in reverse), and when you've finished 
building the string, just reverse it in place.
<!--
(You already know how to reverse an array, 
as you did it in a <a href="../../projects/2/index.html">previous homework assignment</a>.)

<b>Files:</b>
<p>
The function goes in a C file named <tt>inttostr.c</tt>. The command line to build the program is:

<blockquote><pre>
gcc -O -Werror -Wall -Wextra -ansi -pedantic main.c inttostr.c -o inttostr
</pre></blockquote>

This is a partial <tt>inttostr.c</tt> with functions to get you started.

<a name="NOTES"></a>
<p class="SectionHeader">Notes</p>
<ul>
  <li>You have already done a few exercises which required you to extract individual digits from a number.
    This is trivial and you should not have any problems with this part of the algorithm.</li>
  <p>
  <li>The only library function you will need is <tt>strlen</tt>. This is the prototype for <tt>strlen</tt>:
<blockquote><pre>
size_t strlen(const char *string);
</pre></blockquote>
<tt>strlen</tt> returns the length of the string, which is the number of characters in the string. 
It does not include the terminating NUL byte in the count. The type <tt>size_t</tt> is basically
an unsigned integer type that you can use, if needed.
<p>
  <li>Before writing C code, write down the steps that are required for you to implement the solution.
    This is especially true if you don't have a lot of experience writing C code. If you just
    start "hacking" code, you may find you're wasting a lot of time.</li>
    <p>
</ul>
<p>
<p class="Extra">For students that would like an additional challenge: (Do not submit this.)</p>
<ol>
  <li>Write a function called <tt>floattostr</tt> converts a floating point number
    into a string. For example, the <tt><b>float</b></tt> value <tt>3.14159</tt>
    will be converted to this string:

<blockquote><pre>
"3.14159"
</pre></blockquote>

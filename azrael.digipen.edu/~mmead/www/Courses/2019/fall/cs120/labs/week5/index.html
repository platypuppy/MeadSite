Information

<p class="technote">
Please read this entire page before starting to write code. You'll be glad you did.
(You are instructed to do something before starting this lab. <b>NEVER</b> ignore
any instructions given.)
<br><br>
<b>Part 1 of this lab requires about 12 lines of code.</b><br>
<b>Part 2 of this lab requires about 8 lines of code.</b><br>
<br>
This does not count variable declarations, comments, or curly braces. 
</p>


You will be creating two functions during this lab: <tt><b>print_cubes</b></tt> and
<tt><b>print_pythagorean_triples</b></tt>
<ol>
	
<li>Write a function called <tt><b>print_cubes</b></tt> that will print all  
  <i>3-digit integers</i> that have the <i>cube</i> property. 

The prototype looks like this:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>void</b> print_cubes(<b>void</b>);
</pre></blockquote>

  An integer has this property if the cube of its digits add up to the number itself. 
  For example, 153 has this property:
	
<blockquote><pre>
<big>153 = 1<sup>3</sup> + 5<sup>3</sup> + 3<sup>3</sup> = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153</big>
</pre></blockquote>

The output of the program should look like this:
<blockquote><pre>
153 has the cube property. (1 + 125 + 27)
370 has the cube property. (27 + 343 + 0)

etc...
</pre></blockquote>

Hint: To extract the digits of the number, use the division and/or the 
modulus operators: <tt><big>/  %</big></tt>

<p>

Remember that integer arithmetic will always truncate the result if it is not an 
integer. 
<p>
To test all 3-digit numbers, you will need to loop from 100 up to and including
999. (That's all of the 3-digit numbers.)
<p>
The easiest way to extract the last digit of a number is to use the modulo
operator with the value 10. For example, <tt>123 % 10</tt> is 3, which is the last digit in
the number. This technique will always give you the last digit of any integer.
<p>
To extract the first digit, just divide the number by 100, so 
<tt>123 / 100</tt> is 1. 
<p>
Extracting the middle digit is only slightly more involved using both operators,
but you should be able to figure out a way to do that. 


<p>
<hr width="90%">
<p>

<li>Write a function that finds 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple">Pythagorean Triples</a>. 

The prototype looks like this:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>void</b> print_pythagorean_triples(<b>int</b> low, <b>int</b> high);
</pre></blockquote>
The inputs are the range [low, high) of values that you should try. For example, this 
call:
<blockquote><pre>
print_pythagorean_triples(1, 100);
</pre></blockquote>
would try all of the integers from 1 up to 99. The range includes the low number,
but not the high number, hence the range: [low, high)
<p>

  Three integers are Pythagorean triples if they have the property that the square of 
  the largest value is equal to the sum of the squares of the two smaller values.
	For example, the integers (3, 4, and 5) are triples as well as others:
	
<blockquote><pre>
<big>3<sup>2</sup> +   4<sup>2</sup> =  5<sup>2</sup>  (  9 +   16 =   25)</big>
<big>5<sup>2</sup> +  12<sup>2</sup> = 13<sup>2</sup>  ( 25 +  144 =  169)</big>
<big>28<sup>2</sup> + 45<sup>2</sup> = 53<sup>2</sup>  (784 + 2025 = 2809)</big>
</pre></blockquote>

There are an infinite number of Pythagorean triples and many ways to calculate them. 
The purpose of this assignment is to practice your coding with for loops, so that's how 
you should do it. (Hint: you will use 3 nested for-loops. Use <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, and <i>k</i> 
for the loop counters.) The output of the program should look like this:

<blockquote><pre>
Triple #  1:   3,  4,  5 -->    9 +   16 =   25
Triple #  2:   5, 12, 13 -->   25 +  144 =  169
Triple #  3:   6,  8, 10 -->   36 +   64 =  100
Triple #  4:   7, 24, 25 -->   49 +  576 =  625
Triple #  5:   8, 15, 17 -->   64 +  225 =  289
Triple #  6:   9, 12, 15 -->   81 +  144 =  225
Triple #  7:   9, 40, 41 -->   81 + 1600 = 1681
Triple #  8:  10, 24, 26 -->  100 +  576 =  676
Triple #  9:  11, 60, 61 -->  121 + 3600 = 3721
Triple # 10:  12, 16, 20 -->  144 +  256 =  400
Triple # 11:  12, 35, 37 -->  144 + 1225 = 1369
Triple # 12:  13, 84, 85 -->  169 + 7056 = 7225
Triple # 13:  14, 48, 50 -->  196 + 2304 = 2500
Triple # 14:  15, 20, 25 -->  225 +  400 =  625
Triple # 15:  15, 36, 39 -->  225 + 1296 = 1521

etc...
</pre></blockquote>

Use this format string so that you get the exact output:
<blockquote><pre>
"Triple #%3i: %3i,%3i,%3i --> %4i + %4i = %4i\n" 
</pre></blockquote>

Notice that the 3 numbers are in increasing order. The first number is the smallest, 
the third number is the largest, and the second number is in between. This means 
that each loop starts on 1 plus the previous number. You'll be doing a sequence 
like this: (The 3 numbers are <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, and <i>k</i>)

<blockquote><pre>
i j k
-----
1 2 3
1 2 4 
1 2 5
1 2 6
...
1 2 99
1 3 4
1 3 5
1 3 6
...
1 3 99
1 4 5
1 4 6
1 4 7
...
1 4 99
1 5 6
1 5 7

etc...
</pre></blockquote>

For each triple, <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, and <i>k</i>, 
if <tt><i>i</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>j</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>k</i><sup>2</sup></tt>,
you will print those values.


<hr width="90%">

Here is the <tt>main</tt> function for you to use. Copy and paste it in a file 
called <tt>main.c</tt>. Note that you don't need to include <tt>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</tt>
because the <tt><b>main</b></tt> function isn't printing anything. 
(Your code is doing the printing this time.) 

<blockquote><pre>

This is the start of the file <tt>triple_cube.c</tt> where you will implement the two
functions:
<p>
<table>

<pre class="sourcecode"><code><font color="990099">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; /* printf */</font>

<b>void</b> print_cubes(<b>void</b>)
{
}

<b>void</b> print_pythagorean_triples(<b>int</b> low, <b>int</b> high)
{

<p>

The command line to build the program:

<blockquote><pre>
gcc -Wall -Wextra -ansi -pedantic -Werror -O2 main.c triple_cube.c -o triple_cube
</pre></blockquote>

Note that the only header file you are to include in your C file is <tt>stdio.h</tt> 
(you don't need any others).

<p class="technote">
<b>You are only allowed to include stdio.h in your code. Including any other header
  file will cause you to receive a 0 on the lab.</b>
</p>


<p>
Download (<b>DO NOT SAVE THE WEB PAGE</b>) the output from the program: 
<a href="output.txt">output.txt</a>  
<p>
Don't forget that you may need to use the <tt>--strip-trailing-cr</tt> switch with <tt><b>diff</b></tt>.
<p>
<b>Notes:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Notice that you are not prompting the user for anything. The driver file (<tt>main.c</tt>) is
    calling your function with the appropriate values (if any).</li>
  <li>Most labs from now on will not require you to ask the user for any input. The input required
    for your functions will come from the driver.</li>
  <li>You should never assume that the values shown in these examples will be the same values that
    you will be given when your program is run. Often, I will provide a different driver file when
    I compile and run your code.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<b>BEFORE</b> starting the lab, try to figure out what this code prints:

<pre class="sourcecode"><code><font color="990099">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</font>

<b>int</b> main(<b>void</b>)
{
  <b>int</b> i, j, k;
  <b>int</b> size = 3;

  <b>for</b> (i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)
    <b>for</b> (j = 0; j &lt; size; j++)
      <b>for</b> (k = 0; k &lt; size; k++)
        printf(<font color="#9933CC">&quot;%i, %i, %i&#92;n&quot;</font>, i, j, k);
}
</code></pre>

Compile and run this code to check yourself. Change the <i>size</i> variable and observe
what is printed. What would happen if you added another nested loop after the <i>k</i> loop?
(Try it.)

Use this as a model for nested loops.

<hr>

</ol>

<b>Timing your code</b>
<p>
The algorithm that I suggested (3 nested for-loops for the Pythagorean triples), 
will provide efficient run-time behavior of your program. If you choose to do it some other way
(not recommended), you may find that your program is inefficient.
<p>
There is a program that comes with Cygwin (it's built-in to Linux and Mac) called <b>time</b>. It allows
you to time the running of programs. It's very easy to use. If you want to see how long it takes your
program to run, do this (on Windows):

<blockquote><pre>
c:\cygwin64\bin\time -p ./triple_cube.exe
</pre></blockquote>

This assumes you installed Cygwin into the recommended directory. You MUST provide the entire
PATH. Simply typing just <tt>time</tt>, will not work.

On Mac and Linux, you just need to run (from a bash shell):

<blockquote><pre>
time ./triple_cube
</pre></blockquote>

to see your times. 


On the submission server (pontus.digipen.edu), my program produces this output:

<blockquote><pre>
real  0m0.007s
user  0m0.000s
sys   0m0.005s
</pre></blockquote>

The <i>real</i> time is what you're looking at. It says my program took 0.007 seconds 
(that's 7/1000ths of a second)
to run. Your time should be similar in that it should run faster than 0.01 seconds. I'm giving you 0.500
seconds, which is over <i>50 times slower than the average!</i> If you finish within that time, you'll get
credit, otherwise you won't. 
<p>
There is NOTHING you need to do to get your program running in this time
except to follow the instructions. Failure to follow the instructions may lead you to get very
poor performance.
<p>

<blockquote>
<p class="technote">
Realize, of course, that if you have a faster computer, your programs will run faster. If you have a
slower computer, your programs will run slower. It really depends. But, since everyone is running
on pontus.digipen.edu, everyone's program will be timed the same way. 
<br><br>
In CS180, we'll see how different CPU architectures can make programs run faster or slower.
Hope to see some of you there next semester!

Please read this entire page <i>before</i> starting to code. You should also 
read it again <em>during</em> coding to see if you've missed something.
You will use the function written in part 1 to help you implement the function
in part 2.

Part 1 of this lab requires <b>about</b> 10 lines of code.

Part 2 of this lab requires <b>about</b> 12 lines of code.

<li>Write a function that can determine if an integer is a prime number. The function should return
  <tt>true</tt> (the integer 1), if the number is prime and <tt>false</tt> (the integer 0), if it 
  is not prime. The prototype looks like this:
	
<blockquote><pre>
<b>int</b> is_prime(<b>int</b> number);
</pre></blockquote>

For example, here is a list of all of the prime numbers between 2 and 100:
<blockquote><pre>
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
</pre></blockquote>

<b>Hints</b>: (Please heed this advice unless you know what you're doing. Even then you should
follow it!)
<p>
You will need to use the modulus operator: <tt><big>%</big></tt> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? 
Because a prime number is only equally divisible by itself and one. So, if you find another value 
that divides your number equally, then it can't be prime, can it? 
<p>
By definition 1 is not prime and 2 
is prime, so you can return <b>false</b> or <b>true</b> immediately for those numbers, respectively. Also, 
another quick check to do is to see if the number is even. Even numbers (except 2) are not prime.
If <tt>number % 2 == 0</tt>, then <tt>number</tt> is not prime and you can return <b>false</b>
immediately.
<p>
You need to use a loop to try all of the odd numbers from 3 up to the given number divided by 2. 
If any of those odd numbers can divide the given number evenly, 
then the given number isn't prime. 
If none of them divide it evenly, then the number is prime. Why stop at the number divided by 2? 
Because the largest value that divides a number evenly is half the number.
For example, if the number is 100, the largest value that will divide it evenly is 50. No number 
larger than 50 will divide into it evenly (51, 52, 53, ... etc., are all too big).

<li>There is a conjecture in mathematics (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach_conjecture">Goldbach conjecture</a>) 
  that every even number can be written as the sum of two prime numbers. It has never been proven true 
  mathematically, but a counter-example has never been found either. Here are some examples of even 
  numbers and the primes that sum to the value:
	
<blockquote><pre>
  4 =  2 +   2
  6 =  3 +   3
  8 =  3 +   5
 10 =  3 +   7
 12 =  5 +   7	
    .
    .
    . 
122 = 13 + 109
124 = 11 + 113
126 = 13 + 113
128 = 19 + 109 
    .
    .
    .
194 =  3 + 191
196 =  3 + 193
198 =  5 + 193
200 =  3 + 197 
 
etc...
</pre></blockquote>

You need to write a function named <i>conjecture</i> that will take a range (inclusive) of numbers and
show that each even number within the range is the sum of two prime numbers. The prototype looks like this:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>void</b> conjecture(<b>int</b> low, <b>int</b> high);
</pre></blockquote>

The output is as above. The format string for the <i>printf</i> function is: <tt>"%3i = %3i + %3i\n"</tt>. 
Be sure you use that so you can <b>diff</b> properly.
<p>
<b>Hint #1</b>: You will use 3 nested loops. One to loop over the range (low to high), a second loop 
to find the first prime number, and the third loop will find the second prime number. You will need 
to use the <i>is_prime</i> function you wrote above. 
<p>
If you want to find the pair of prime numbers that add up to X, you are essentially trying all of 
the pairs of prime numbers from 2 up to the largest prime number less than X. So, you start with 
the first prime number as 2, and the second prime number will be 2, 3, 5, 7, etc., until you
find a pair that adds up to the even number, like this: 2 + 2, then 2 + 3, then 2 + 5, 
then 2 + 7, 2 + 11, 2 + 13, 2 + 15, etc. 
<p>
If you don't find a pair that adds up to X with 2 as the first prime, you try 3 as the first prime. 
You would try these: 3 + 3, 3 + 5, 3 + 7, 3 + 11, 3 + 13, etc. Notice the output below. Most even 
numbers have several pairs of primes that add up to the number. You want the first pair, which 
means the <b>first number in the pair is always less than or equal to 
the second one. Always.</b>
<p>
For example, the even number 12 is the sum of the primes 5 and 7. If you had a nested loop using
<i>i</i> and <i>j</i> as loop variables, you would try these combinations until you discovered that
5 and 7 were the solution:
<blockquote><pre>
  i   j
-------
  2   2
  2   3
  2   4
  2   5
  2   6
  2   7
  2   8
  2   9
<font color="black"><b>  2  10</b></font>    &lt;--- 10 is not prime (increment <i>i</i>)
  3   3
  3   4
  3   5
  3   6
  3   7
  3   8
<font color="black"><b>  3   9</b></font>    &lt;--- 9 is not prime (increment <i>i</i>)
  5   5
  5   6
<font color="red"><b>  5   7</b></font>    &lt;--- both are prime (stop here and print)
</pre></blockquote>

The highlighted pairs show that, the two numbers add up to 12, but since the second number is not
prime, it doesn't count. The first number is then incremented up to the next prime (3 in this case),
and the <i>j</i> loop starts at the same value and continues. The last pair of primes is the solution
for 12.
<p>
Note that you are not printing out the entire list of attempts, just the successful pairs. I'm just
showing you how the nested loop progresses with each iteration of <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>.

<blockquote><pre>
</pre></blockquote>



<b>Hint #2</b>: You may want to use some <b><tt>break</tt></b> statements in your loops. Why? Because 
as soon as you find a pair of prime numbers that add up to X, you want to stop looking (break out) 
for other primes and move to the next even number. This is where the <b><tt>break</tt></b>
statement comes in very handy. You could write logic without using <b><tt>break</tt></b>, but it
will be more complicated and error prone.
Refer to the textbook or the 
<a href="../../../../../CS120/Iteration-1.html#MORELOOPING">online notes</a> that discussed 
the <b><tt>break</tt></b> statement and the examples using the 
<a href="../../../../../CS120/Iteration-1.html#NESTEDLOOPS"> <b><tt>break</tt></b> 
  statement with nested loops</a>.

<p>
The output shown below is from the call: <tt>conjecture(2, 20);</tt>
<p>
Notice again how the first prime number is always less than (or equal) to the second prime number.
As the numbers grow larger, the second prime number is much larger than the first one.

<p>
In <tt>main.c</tt>, you should comment out or remove the call to <tt>conjecture</tt> until you've completed
the first part of the lab. Then, you can start working on <tt>conjecture</tt>.
<p>
The command line to build the program will be:

<blockquote><pre>
<big>gcc -Werror -Wall -Wextra -ansi -pedantic -O2 main.c primes1.c -o primes1</big>
</pre></blockquote>

<!--
When creating stub functions, you may need this <b><i>temporarily</i></b>
<blockquote><pre>
-Wno-unused-parameter
</pre></blockquote>
-->

Note that the only header file you are to include in your C file is <tt>stdio.h</tt> 
(you won't need any others). Also, notice the first command-line switch 
<b><tt>-Werror</tt></b>. This will treat warnings as errors so that you can't execute 
a program that has warnings. (No executable file will be created.)
<p>
Don't forget that you may need to use the <tt>--strip-trailing-cr</tt> switch with <tt><b>diff</b></tt>.

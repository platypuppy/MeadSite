<h1>CS 120 - Lab Assignment<p></h1>

</center>

<p class="technote">
This is the first <i>Real Lab</i><sup>&trade;</sup> of the semester, meaning, all of the others were just
practices to get to this point. This lab will test your ability to follow instructions, use loops, 
conditionals, arrays, functions, etc. There are 3 distinct portions to this lab and they must be done
in order. <b>READ</b> each section closely <b>BEFORE</b> you write a single line of code. If there is
something you don't understand, <b>ASK BEFORE</b> you start wrting code.
<br><br>
As with all labs and assignments, if you follow the instructions, this is not difficult at all. If
you ignore all of the advice that has been given, you will likely fail.
</p>

<p class="SectionHeader">
Information
</p>


In this lab assignment you will practice using arrays and formatted output. 
You will also practice following a specific algorithm. Your goal is to print out a monthly calendar for any year from 1700 onwards. 
This includes dealing with any leap years, as well. For example, here are a few calendars:

<blockquote>
<table border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=0>
<tr valign="top">

</pre></blockquote>
</td>

</blockquote>

If you just start coding without thinking, you will quickly find that you are unable to manage the task. 
However, if you break the task down into smaller chunks, you will find that it isn't as difficult as it 
first appears. We are going to break it down into 3 parts. Each part requires you to create 
a single function.
<p>
There is really only 3 pieces of information that you need in order to print a calendar for
a specific month. You need to know:

<ol>
  <li>whether or not the year is a leap year.</li>
  <li>the day of the week the month starts on.</li>
  <li>the number of days in the month.</li>
</ol>

That's it! That's all you need to know. The number of days in the month is well-known
and is provided, so you
will just be creating functions to calculate the other two pieces of information.
<p>
<blockquote>
<p class="technote">
Work on each function, one-at-a-time, testing it before moving on to the next function.
This is exactly how all software, regardless of complexity, should be written.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<p>
<hr width="100%">
<p>

<!--****************************************************************************************-->
<!--****************************************************************************************-->
<!--****************************************************************************************-->

<li>The first function that you are going to write is called <tt>is_leapyear</tt> and the prototype 
  looks like this:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>int</b> is_leapyear(<b>int</b> year);
</pre></blockquote>

The purpose of the function is pretty self-explanatory: Given a year, return TRUE (1) if the year
represents a leap year or FALSE (0), if the year doesn't represent a leap year. A leap year is a
year that is evenly divisible by 4 with this exception:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>if the year is divisible by 100 it's not a leap year unless it is also divisible by 400,
    in which case it is a leap year.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is a trivial function to write and you will need it to do the rest of the lab.
<p>
<font color="blue">Number of lines of code is about <b>8</b>.</font>
You can certainly do it in less lines, but your logic will be much more complicated.
<p>
Implement and test this function before moving on.

<p>
<hr width="100%">
<p>
<!--****************************************************************************************-->
<!--****************************************************************************************-->
<!--****************************************************************************************-->
<li>The second function that you are going to write is called <tt>day_of_the_week</tt> and the 
  prototype looks like this:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>int</b> day_of_the_week(<b>int</b> day, <b>int</b> month, <b>int</b> year);
</pre></blockquote>

This function is also pretty self-explanatory: Given a date (day, month, year, in that order), 
determine which day of the week the date falls on. In the 3 calendars above, the first day 
of each month falls on a Wednesday, Monday, and Thursday, respectively. 
<b>The function returns 1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, 3 for Tuesday, etc.</b>
<p>
There are many ways to calculate this, and some are more complicated than others. One method
is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determination_of_the_day_of_the_week#Zeller.E2.80.99s_algorithm">
Zeller's Rule</a>. However, we are going to use a different, simpler key/value method that is very 
different from Zeller's algorithm. 
<p>
This algorithm is as follows. We'll use the date December 15, 2014 as an example:
<ol>
  <li>Extract the last 2 digits of the year using the modulus operator. (2014 % 100 = 14)</li>
  <p>
  <li>Divide that number by 4 using integer division. (14 / 4 = 3)</li>
  <p>
  <li>Add the day of the month. (3 + 15 = 18)</li>
  <p>
  <li>Add the month's <i>key value</i> from this table:
    <p>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0>
      <tr><th>Jan</th><th>Feb</th><th>Mar</th><th>Apr</th><th>May</th><th>Jun</th><th>Jul</th><th>Aug</th><th>Sept</th><th>Oct</th><th>Nov</th><th>Dec</th></tr>
      <tr align="center"><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>6</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
    The month is December, so the key value is 6. (18 + 6 = 24)</li>
      <p>
  <li>If the date is in January or February <b>AND</b> the year is a leap year, subtract 1 
    from the total so far. (Use the <tt>is_leapyear</tt> you wrote previously.) 
    Since 2014 is <b>NOT</b> a leap you, you do nothing for December 15, 2014.</li>
  <p>
  <li>Add the <i>century code</i> from the following table:
    <p>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0>
      <tr><th>1700-1799</th><th>1800-1899</th><th>1900-1999</th><th>2000-2099</th></tr>
      <tr align="center"><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>6</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
    The example year is 2014, so we add 6: (24 + 6 = 30)
    <p>
    If the year is not in the table (e.g. the year 3030), you just keep subtracting 400 
    from the year until you get one of the centuries that is in the table. 
    (Hint: Use a <b>while</b> loop).
    For 3030, you would do
    3030 - 400 = 2630, then 2630 - 400 = 2230, then 2230 - 400 = 1830 and use that value for
    the 1800's. (The reason this works is because the Gregorian calendar repeats every 400 years.)
    <p>
    <li>Add the last 2 digits (that you extracted in step #1) to the total. (30 + 14 = 44)</li>
    <p>
    <li>Finally, divide by 7 and take the remainder using the modulus operator. (44 % 7 = 2)
      <br>
      <b>
      In this scheme above, Saturday is 0, Sunday is 1, Monday is 2, ... Friday is 6. In our example, 
      December 15, 2014 falls on a Monday. You need to make sure your function returns
      1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, 3 for Tuesday, ... 7 for Saturday, as that is the scheme 
      we are using (1 to 7 instead of 0 to 6).</b></li>
</ol>
<p>
This may seem complicated, but it's really just simple 5th grade <strike>math</strike> arithmetic, 
nothing more. You just need to turn each step of the algorithm above into C code.

<blockquote>
<p class="technote">
Each numbered item above represents one step in the algorithm. Many of the steps will require
only one line of C code. Some steps will require more. The hardest part of this lab
is coming up with algorithm. However, I am giving you the algorithm in a step-by-step fashion,
requiring no effort on your part.
<br><br>
You just need to convert each English phrase into C code.

<p>
<!--****************************************************************************************-->
<!--****************************************************************************************-->
<!--****************************************************************************************-->
<li>Ok, now that you have those two functions, you are ready to actually print a monthly calendar.
The third function that you are going to write is called <tt>print_calendar</tt> and the 
  prototype looks like this:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>void</b> print_calendar(<b>int</b> month, <b>int</b> year);
</pre></blockquote>
To print the second calendar that is displayed above (July 1776), you would simply call it like this:
<blockquote><pre>
print_calendar(7, 1776);
</pre></blockquote>
and the output would be:
<blockquote><pre>
July, 1776
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
---------------------
    1  2  3  4  5  6 
 7  8  9 10 11 12 13 
14 15 16 17 18 19 20 
21 22 23 24 25 26 27 
28 29 30 31 
</pre></blockquote>

Your task is to print out the calendar, properly formatted, with help from the 2 functions you wrote 
previously. That's why we wrote those separately. Trying to do all of the work in one function is just
a recipe for failure. It will take some time to get the formatting correct, and there will be a 
little trial and error until you get it exact. None of this work is beyond what you're expected 
to do at this point in the course.

Other notes:
<ul>
  <li>Remember that arrays are indexed starting from 0. This program uses January as month 1
    and Sunday as the first (1) day of the week. Make sure to compensate for these.
    (The reason we don't start at 0 is because calendars are for <i>humans</i>, not computers.
    Humans expect that January to December is 1 to 12, not 0 to 11.)</li>
    <p>
  <li>The algorithm using key/values for calculating the day of the week has Saturday as 0. Make sure you 
    compensate for this as well since our scheme has Saturday as 7.</li>
    <p>
  <li>You are given an array of literal strings in the <tt>print_calendar</tt> function. You
    are also given the <tt>printf</tt> statement for them. %s is the format specifier for strings. You
    won't need this anywhere else.</li>
    <p>
  <li>There is a program that is included with the Cygwin utilities called <b>cal.exe</b> (just plain
    <b>cal</b> on Linux and Mac OS X) that does a similar thing. To print any month, give it the month
    (by number) and the year. To print October, 2014, do this:
    <blockquote><pre>
cal 10 2014
</pre></blockquote>
Just typing <b>cal</b>, will give you a print out of the current month and year. It has an additional
feature where the current day is highlighted. Typing just a year (e.g. <tt><b>cal 2014</b></tt>), gives 
you all 12 months. Try it. (And be thankful you're just printing out a single month!) To find out
more about it, type <tt><b>man cal</b></tt> at the command prompt.
</li>
<p>
<li>Finally:
<xblockquote>
  <p class="technote">
    This is probably the most involved lab in CS120 thus far, as this is where I expect students
  to be at after 8 weeks of class. Everything you need for this lab has been done before
  (functions, conditionals, iteration, arrays, etc.) The difference this time is that you are probably
  writing more lines of code than you have before. The previous labs, assignments, and practices that you
  have completed have led up to this point. If you have not been keeping up with the labs,
  assignments, and practices, you may find this lab difficult to complete.

<b>For students that would like an additional challenge:</b> (Do not submit this.)
<p>

For the calendar program to be more useful (and convenient) for the user (which is the goal
of <i>all</i> software), modify the program to support these additional "features":
<ol>

<li>If the user provides the month and year on the command line, the program should print the
  calendar for that month/year. For example, if the user types this:
<blockquote><pre>
calendar 2 2012
</pre></blockquote>
the program should display the calendar for February, 2012:
<blockquote><pre>
February, 2012
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
---------------------
          1  2  3  4 
 5  6  7  8  9 10 11 
12 13 14 15 16 17 18 
19 20 21 22 23 24 25 
26 27 28 29
</pre></blockquote>

<li>If the user supplies just the month on the command line, the program should display the month
  for the current year. For example, if the current year is 2020 and the user types:
<blockquote><pre>
calendar 2
</pre></blockquote>
the program should display the calendar for February, 2020
<blockquote><pre>
February, 2020
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
---------------------
                   1 
 2  3  4  5  6  7  8 
 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 
16 17 18 19 20 21 22 
23 24 25 26 27 28 29 
</pre></blockquote>
</li>
<p>

  <li>If the user just types <b>calendar</b>, have the program print out the calendar for the
    current month and year. For example, if today's date is October 29, 2022 (or any day in 
    October 2022 for that matter) and the user types:
<blockquote><pre>
calendar
</pre></blockquote>
the program should display the calendar for October, 2022
<blockquote><pre>
October, 2022
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
---------------------
                   1 
 2  3  4  5  6  7  8 
 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 
16 17 18 19 20 21 22 
23 24 25 26 27 28 29 
30 31 
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
</li>
</ol>
Be sure to handle invalid input. 
<p>

Example 1:  
<blockquote><pre>
calendar 15
</pre></blockquote>
Output:
<blockquote><pre>
Month must be between 1 and 12.
</pre></blockquote>

Example 2:  
<blockquote><pre>
calendar 2 -2015
</pre></blockquote>
Output:
<blockquote><pre>
Year must be a positive number.
</pre></blockquote>

Hints:
<ul>
  <li><b>DO NOT modify your <tt>calendar.c</tt> file in any way.</b> You should create a new
    <tt>main.c</tt> file (maybe name it <tt>main2.c</tt>), and put all of the logic there.
    Use this new file to replace the original <tt>main.c</tt> file.
    <p>
    In other words, you've already written a <i>calendar display engine</i>. You just need to
    modify <b>main</b> to drive it. (This is also how Real World<sup>&trade;</sup> software is
    written.)</li>
    <p>
  <li>To access the command line arguments, see Chapter 13, section 7 in the textbook.</li>
    <p>
  <li>Command line arguments are always NUL-terminated strings. To convert them to 
    integers, use the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/atoi.3.html">atoi</a>

    <p>
  <li>To get the current date or time, use the

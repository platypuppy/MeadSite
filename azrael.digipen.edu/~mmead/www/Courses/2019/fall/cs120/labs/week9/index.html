In this lab assignment you will practice using arrays, pointers, and strings and passing them to functions. 
Remember, in C/C++, when you pass an array (or string) to a function, you are actually just passing a 
pointer to the first element of the array. However, since the strings are NUL-terminated, you don't
have to pass the size to the functions. You will also be passing pointers to some functions 
as a way for the called function to communicate information back to the calling function.

<!--****************************************************************************************-->

<li>The first function that you are going to write is <tt>GetCounts</tt> and the prototype looks like this:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>int</b> GetCounts(<b>const</b> <b>char</b> *string, <b>int</b> letters[], <b>int</b> *spaces, <b>int</b> *other);
</pre></blockquote>

The purpose of the function is to count the number of letters, spaces, and other characters in a
string. The <i>string</i> is a NUL-terminated array of (constant) characters. A letter is any
letter from <tt>a</tt> to <tt>z</tt> (either uppercase or lowercase, <tt>a..z</tt> and <tt>A..Z</tt>). Spaces are, well, spaces, and the
<i>other</i> parameter is going to hold the number of other characters (non-letters, non-spaces).
<p>

The meanings of the parameters are described in the table below. Notice the tags of <i><b>in</b></i> and <i><b>out</b></i> 
below. This helps you understand how the parameters are being used inside the function. That is, as inputs and/or outputs.

<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5>
<tr><th>Parameter</th><th>In/Out</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td align="center">string</td><td align="center">IN</td>
<td>
This is a pointer to a <i><b>const</b></i> character, meaning that the function can't change
the characters that are in the string. The function is only going to read the 
characters in the string, not modify them.  
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">letters</td><td align="center">OUT</td>
<td>This is an array of integers that will contain the number of occurrences of each letter (a..z and A..Z).
  The reason I say "will contain" is because, when the array is passed to the function, the elements
  are random garbage. The function is going to fill in the values.
    Note that this array is not marked <i><b>const</b></i> so the function will be allowed to set the values.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">spaces</td><td align="center">OUT</td>
<td>Since this is a pointer to a non-const integer, the function will set it to the number of spaces
    that are in the <i>string</i>.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">other</td><td align="center">OUT</td>
<td>
This is also a pointer to a non-const integer and the function will set this value to the number of
    other characters (i.e. anything but a letter or a space).  
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The return value from <tt>GetCounts</tt> is the <i>total</i> number of letters 
(<tt>a..z</tt> and <tt>A..Z</tt>) that were counted. The count of individual
characters is in the <i>letters</i> array. The reason we are passing pointers for 
<tt>spaces</tt> and <tt>other</tt> is because a function can only return one value. This
function is returning the number of letters found in the sentence. The only way we can
"return" more information is through the pointers passed in to the function. (Well, there are other ways,
but we haven't seen them yet.)

<blockquote>
<p class="technote">
Passing the address of a variable is a very common way of communicating multiple values back to the caller.
You will see this quite often in the C libraries as well as your own code.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Here is an example that calls <tt>GetCounts</tt>:

<pre class="sourcecode"><code><font color="990099">#define NUM_LETTERS 26</font>

<b>int</b> main(<b>void</b>)
{
  <b>int</b> spaces;               <font color="#003399"><i>/* The number of spaces in the string                 */</i></font>
  <b>int</b> total;                <font color="#003399"><i>/* The number of letters (a..z, A..Z) in the string   */</i></font>
  <b>int</b> other;                <font color="#003399"><i>/* The number of other characters in the string       */</i></font>
  <b>int</b> letters[NUM_LETTERS]; <font color="#003399"><i>/* The number of each individual letter in the string */</i></font>

    <font color="#003399"><i>/* Simple test sentence */</i></font>
  <b>const</b> <b>char</b> *a = <font color="#9933CC">&quot;This is simple - a sentence with spaces - and other punctuations.&quot;</font>;

    <font color="#003399"><i>/* Call function and print out results. Do you understand the second argument? */</i></font>
  total = GetCounts(a, letters, &amp;spaces, &amp;other);
  printf(<font color="#9933CC">&quot;Count of letters is: %i, spaces: %i, other: %i&#92;n&quot;</font>, total, spaces, other);

  <b>return</b> 0;
}
</code></pre>

And this is the output from <tt>main</tt>:

<blockquote><pre>
Count of letters is: 51, spaces: 11, other: 3
</pre></blockquote>

The contents of the <tt>letters</tt> array are the number of occurrences of each letter in the string.
In the example above the value of <tt>letters[0]</tt> is 4. This is because the first element in the
array represents the number of times the letter <tt><i>a</i></tt> occurred in the string. The value of
<tt>letters[1]</tt> is 0 because the letter <tt><i>b</i></tt> does not occur in the string. The value of
<tt>letters[2]</tt> is 3, the value of <tt>letters[3]</tt> is 1, etc.
<p>
This is the first part of the lab. In the next part, you will print out information associated with each letter that was found in the strings.
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>This function requires about 18 lines of code.</b></font>

<p>

<p>

<!--****************************************************************************************-->
<!--****************************************************************************************-->
<!--****************************************************************************************-->

<li>The second function that you will write is <tt>PrintHistogram</tt> and the prototype looks like this:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>void</b> PrintHistogram(<b>const</b> <b>int</b> letters[]);  
</pre></blockquote>

The function doesn't return anything and the only parameter is the array of letter counts. 
This array was filled in by the call to the <tt>GetCounts</tt> function you wrote above. Now you 
are using the values in that array to print out information. Notice that we are not passing the number
of elements in the array. This is because there are <i>exactly</i> 26 characters in the English alphabet, 
and we're only concerned about those. That's why we have this:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>#define</b> NUM_LETTERS 26
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The function
will print a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram">histogram</a> of the letters. There will be
one asterisk (<tt>*</tt>) for each occurrence of the letter. Notice that the parameter is tagged with the
<tt><b>const</b></tt> keyword, indicating that the function promises not to modify the elements of the
array. This is important because we may want to display all arrays (const and non-const) with this one
function.
<p>
This is the histogram for the example above:

<blockquote><pre>
A:****
B:
C:***
D:*
E:******
F:
G:
H:***
I:*****
J:
K:
L:*
M:*
N:*****
O:**
P:***
Q:
R:*
S:*******
T:******
U:**
V:
W:*
X:
Y:
Z:
</pre></blockquote>

And, for reference, this was the input string (the quotes are not part of the string):

<blockquote><pre>
<font color="blue">This is simple - a sentence with spaces - and other punctuations.</font>
</pre></blockquote>

Again, in the histogram you can see that the number of times the letter '<tt>A</tt>' 
was encountered was 4, the number of occurrences of the letter '<tt>B</tt>' is 0, the 
letter '<tt>C</tt>' is 3, '<tt>D</tt>' is 4, etc. Please be sure to use <tt><b>diff</b></tt> 
when checking your output to make sure that you format the output <i>exactly</i> as shown since
your code is printing the histogram. <b>Notice that you are not distinguishing between UPPERCASE
and lowercase characters.</b>

<p>

Here is the output from another test case:
<p>
The input string:

<blockquote><tt>
<p class="technote">
When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to
dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to 
assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to 
which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect 
to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes 
which impel them to the separation.
</p>
</tt></blockquote>


<blockquote><pre>
Count of letters is: 330, spaces: 70, other: 6
A:**************************
B:**
C:*************
D:***********
E:**************************************************
F:******
G:**

I:*****************

O:***************************
P:*********
Q:**
R:**************
S:**********************
T:*************************************
U:*********
V:***
W:*******
X:
Y:**
Z:
</pre></blockquote>

You'll notice some things that are somewhat obvious with the English language: The letter 'E' is the most
"popular" character, followed by the letter "T". Other languages will have a different distribution of
letters. (As an aside, this is how the game <tt>SCRABBLE<sup>TM</sup></tt> determines how the point values
are awarded for each letter/word.)
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>This function requires about 8 lines of code.</b></font>

<!--****************************************************************************************-->
<!--****************************************************************************************-->
<!--****************************************************************************************-->

<li>The third function you will write is <tt>GetStatistics</tt> and the prototype looks like:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>void</b> GetStatistics(<b>const</b> <b>int</b> letters[], <b>double</b> *average, <b>char</b> *max_letter, <b>int</b> *max_count);
</pre></blockquote>

The purpose of this function is to return various information about the string. The
parameters are:
<p>
<ul>
  <li><i>letters</i> - (in) The array of counts that was filled in by the <tt>GetCounts</tt> function.</li>
  <li><i>average</i> - (out) The "average" of the letters (described below).</li>
  <li><i>max_letter</i> - (out) The letter that appeared the most in the string.</li>
  <li><i>max_count</i> - (out) The number of times that <i>max_letter</i> appeared in the string.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Using the example above:

<blockquote><pre>
<font color="blue">This is simple - a sentence with spaces - and other punctuations.</font>
</pre></blockquote>

The histogram (showing the "score" for each letter to the right). 
Note that you are NOT printing the stuff in <font color="blue">BLUE</font>.
I'm just showing you how to calculate the scores.

<blockquote><pre>
A:****     <font color="blue"><xb> 1 x 4 =   4</xb></font>
B:         <font color="blue"><xb> 2 x 0 =   0</xb></font>
C:***      <font color="blue"><xb> 3 x 3 =   9</xb></font>
D:*        <font color="blue"><xb> 4 x 1 =   4</xb></font>
E:******   <font color="blue"><xb> 5 x 6 =  30</xb></font>
F:         <font color="blue"><xb> 6 x 0 =   0</xb></font>
G:         <font color="blue"><xb> 7 x 0 =   0</xb></font>
H:***      <font color="blue"><xb> 8 x 3 =  24</xb></font>
I:*****    <font color="blue"><xb> 9 x 5 =  45</xb></font>
J:         <font color="blue"><xb>10 x 0 =   0</xb></font>
K:         <font color="blue"><xb>11 x 0 =   0</xb></font>
L:*        <font color="blue"><xb>12 x 1 =  12</xb></font>
M:*        <font color="blue"><xb>13 x 1 =  13</xb></font>
N:*****    <font color="blue"><xb>14 x 5 =  70</xb></font>
O:**       <font color="blue"><xb>15 x 2 =  30</xb></font>
P:***      <font color="blue"><xb>16 x 3 =  48</xb></font>
Q:         <font color="blue"><xb>17 x 0 =   0</xb></font>
R:*        <font color="blue"><xb>18 x 1 =  18</xb></font>
S:*******  <font color="blue"><xb>19 x 7 = 133</xb></font>
T:******   <font color="blue"><xb>20 x 6 = 120</xb></font>
U:**       <font color="blue"><xb>21 x 2 =  42</xb></font>
V:         <font color="blue"><xb>22 x 0 =   0</xb></font>
W:*        <font color="blue"><xb>23 x 1 =  23</xb></font>
X:         <font color="blue"><xb>24 x 0 =   0</xb></font>
Y:         <font color="blue"><xb>25 x 0 =   0</xb></font>
Z:         <font color="blue"><xb>26 x 0 =   0</xb></font>
           <font color="blue"><xb>------------</xb></font>
                    <font color="blue"><xb>625</xb></font>
</pre></blockquote>

Calculate the "average" by adding up the totals and dividing by 26 (actually, <tt>NUM_LETTERS</tt>). 
The position in the alphabet gives the "weight" of the letter. So, the letter <tt>A</tt> is worth 1, 
<tt>B</tt> is worth 2, <tt>C</tt> is worth 3, ..., and <tt>Z</tt> is worth 26. Multiply the letter's
worth by the number of occurrences, add everything up, and divide by the number of letters:

<blockquote><pre>
625 / 26 = 24.03846
</pre></blockquote>

This is a code snippet showing how to call <tt>GetStatistics</tt>:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>int</b> max;
<b>double</b> average;
<b>char</b> letter;

GetStatistics(letters, &amp;average, &amp;letter, &amp;max);
printf(<font color="#9933CC">&quot;Average: %.5f, max letter: %c, max count: %i&#92;n&quot;</font>, average, letter, max);
</pre></blockquote>

<blockquote><pre>
</pre></blockquote>


<blockquote><pre>
</pre></blockquote>

and it yields this output:


<blockquote><pre>
Average: 24.03846, max letter: S, max count: 7
</pre></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="technote">
Notice that the variables: <tt>max</tt>, <tt>average</tt>, and <tt>letter</tt> are undefined when you
pass them to the <tt>GetCounts</tt> function. The compiler does not warn you about this. You MUST
understand why that is.
</p>
</blockquote>

<font color="blue"><b>This function requires about 10 lines of code.</b></font>


</ol>   

<p>
<hr width="90%">
<p>

<b>Other notes:</b>
<ul>
  <li>You are not distinguishing between uppercase letters and lowercase letters, 
    e.g. <tt>a</tt> and <tt>A</tt> are considered the same character. There is a function
    in the C library called 
    <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cctype/toupper/"><tt>toupper</tt></a>,
    which will convert a character to uppercase, if you want to use it.
    <p>
  <li>The data pointed at by the pointers passed to the <tt>GetCounts</tt> function may be
    garbage. In other words, for example, the values in the <tt>letters</tt> array may be random
    garbage. You must initialize those values to 0 <i>before</i> starting to count the occurrences of
    each letter. The same is true for the other pointers (e.g. <tt>spaces</tt>).
  </li>
  <p>
  <li>Instead of creating 26 different variables 
  (one for the letter <tt>A</tt>, one for <tt>B</tt>, one for <tt>C</tt> etc.), we are
  simply creating an array of 26 elements, one for each letter of the alphabet. This makes
  it much simpler to count the letters because we can use a loop. Index 0 is for <tt>A</tt>,
  index 1 is for <tt>B</tt>, index 2 is for <tt>C</tt>, and so on with index 25 referring
  to the count for <tt>Z</tt>.</li>
  <p>
  <li>It is easy to use the uppercase letter as an index into the <tt>letters</tt> arrray. All
    you have to do is subtract the integer '<tt>A</tt>' from the letter. For example, if 
    <tt>letter</tt> is <tt>A</tt> and you do this: <tt>letter - 'A'</tt>, the result is 0, which
    is the first slot in the array. If <tt>letter</tt> is <tt>J</tt> (the 10th letter of the alphabet)
    and you do this: <tt>letter - 'A'</tt>, the result is 9, which is the index of the 10th letter.
    This should make it very easy to read a character from the sentence and increment the corresponding
    array element. <b>This is one of the reasons that so few lines of code are required 
    for this lab (or any lab/assignment for that matter).</b>
    <p>
  <li>If more than one letter has the most occurrences, select the one that comes first in
    the alphabet. For
    example, if both the letter <tt>A</tt> and the letter <tt>E</tt> have the most 
    occurrences, select the letter <tt>A</tt>.</li>
    <p>
<!--
  <li>Note: If you receive the warning (likely with Cygwin, not with Linux or Mac)
    <blockquote><pre>warning: array subscript has type `char'</pre></blockquote>
    when using <tt>toupper</tt>, you need to cast the argument to an <tt><b>int</b></tt> like this: 
    <blockquote><pre>toupper((<b>int</b>)sentence[i])</pre></blockquote>

    Yes, the warning makes absolutely no sense because the subscript in the statement above is <b>NOT</b> a character. 
    It's clearly an integer and the cast that we're
    providing isn't casting the subscript!! What's going on here!?!? The issue is with the conversion, which you don't see. The macro converts this:
    <blockquote><pre>char letter = toupper(sentence[i]);</pre></blockquote>
    to this (the <font color="blue"><b>highlighted</b></font> portion is the problem):
    <blockquote><pre>char letter = __extension__ ({ __typeof__ (sentence[i]) __x = (sentence[i]); (void) <font color="blue"><b>__ctype_ptr__[__x]</b></font>; (toupper) (__x);});</pre></blockquote>

    It's for reasons like this that many people consider macros evil, or at least something that should be 
    understood thoroughly before using. This is why I discourage students from using macros in CS120: 
    Students 
    just don't understand the problems they can potentially create. 
    Yeah, they look innocent and student's feel <i>cool</i> that they can do this, but it's just a big
    can of worms for very little benefit. Just like you don't need global variables, <tt><b>goto</b></tt>
    statements or other advanced features in CS120, you don't need complicated macros.
    I don't expect anyone in this class to 
    understand the 
    warning because you can't know what a macro may be doing to your code unless a) you've been programming 
    for many years in C, or b) you look at the preprocessed code, which students and beginners rarely do. 
    Just chalk this up to <i>Lesson Learned</i>. (We will not discuss this matter further!)

When you run the program, you should provide the test number to run. If you want to run test
0, you would do this:
<blockquote><pre>
histogram 0  
</pre></blockquote>

If you want to run test 3, you would do this:
<blockquote><pre>
histogram 3
</pre></blockquote>

If you want to run all the tests, don't provide any number:
<blockquote><pre>
histogram
</pre></blockquote>

On Linux and Mac OS X you will likely have to prepend the current directory like this:

If you want to run test 3, you would do this:
<blockquote><pre>
./histogram 3
</pre></blockquote>

Don't forget that you may need to use the <tt>--strip-trailing-cr</tt> option with <tt><b>diff</b></tt>.

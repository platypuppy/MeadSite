<b>IMPORTANT:</b>


<ol>
	<li>DO NOT USE INTERNET EXPLORER IN THIS CLASS. (Unless instructed to do so. Even then, 
		question it!)</li>
	<p>
	<li>When downloading files for the lab DO NOT save the web page, save the file.
		To save the file with Firefox, right-click on the link and choose "Save Link As..."
		This is so that all of the formatting in the file is preserved.</li>
	<p>
	<li>Don't forget that you may need to use the <b><tt>--strip-trailing-cr</tt></b> 
		switch with <tt>diff</tt>
		if it's telling you that all of the lines are different and you know they are not.
		This will happen because Windows uses different end-of-line characters than
		Linux or Mac OS X. The <b><tt>--strip-trailing-cr</tt></b> option tells <tt>diff</tt>
		to ignore the differences in line endings.</li>
	<p>

	<li><a href="http://pontus.digipen.edu/cgi-bin/submission.cgi">Online submission page</a> for 
		the labs. Your username and password are the same as your Digipen login.
		<!--
<p class="technote">
		You will normally have until <b>6:00 pm on Wednesday evening</b> (after the Monday lab) 
		to submit the lab, <b>unless otherwise stated on the lab web page</b>.
</p></li>
-->

<p class="technote">
	All code for the labs <b>MUST</b> follow the 
	<a href="../../../../../docs/CS120StyleGuide.pdf">Style Guide for CS120</a>
	(and the <a href="../../../../../docs/CS120StyleGuide-addendum.pdf">Style Guide Addendum</a>)


	The
	<b>tablen</b> program must be run on your files, as well.
</p>

<!--
<p class="technote">
		When the server accepts your submission, your score will be 10/10. However, the TAs
		will then evaluate your code to ensure you are following the Style Guide. If any deficiencies
		are found, your grade will be lowered.
</p></li>
-->

<li>In order to help automate the testing of your code, the submission server will use input/output
redirection. If you understand this simple concept, it will help you automate your own testing.
<p>
Normally, output (e.g. <tt><b>printf</b></tt>) sends its output to the screen. To send it
to a file instead, use the greater-than (&gt;) symbol:

<blockquote><pre>
myprogram &gt; out.txt
</blockquote>

Any output from <i>myprogram</i> will go to a file named <i>out.txt</i> and you will see nothing on
the screen. 
<p>
Normally, input (e.g. <tt><b>scanf</b></tt>) is read from the keyboard. To have the program read input
from a file instead, use the less-than (&lt;) symbol:

<blockquote><pre>
myprogram &lt; in.txt
</blockquote>

All input to <i>myprogram</i> is read from <i>in.txt</i>, and the keyboard is ignored. Also, none of the 
characters that are in the file will show on the screen.

</li>

<p class="technote">
<b>ALWAYS read the entire webpage (and any PDF handouts) before starting to write
code. This will save you a lot of time, and prevent you from wasting your time and
the TA's time with questions that have already been answered.</b>

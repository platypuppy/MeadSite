<b>Remember:</b> The major point of this lab assignment is for you to learn how to 
submit your homework correctly. You should follow all of the directions <i>exactly</i> 
as specified in the handouts. The syllabus that was handed out during the first day of 
class also contains important information on how to submit your homework. 
If you are still unsure of how to do something, you should ask for help.
The best place to start is on the 
<a href="https://distance.digipen.edu/2019-fall/mod/forum/view.php?id=11164">Moodle Forums</a>.
<!--
either 
on the forums in Moodle, from a tutor, or from another student.

<h2>Information</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="technote">
<b>Always</b> read the entire web page and <a href="cs120-lab-marathon.pdf">Handout</a> 
before starting. You'll be glad you did.
</p>
</blockquote>


<ul>
<li><a href="cs120-lab-marathon.pdf">Handout</a> 
  <p>
<li><a href="../../../../../CS120/Fundamentals-1.html#MARATHON">marathon.c</a> from the first week.
  Make sure when you paste this you get the lines in the correct spot. 
  (See <a href="../../../../../CS120/Fundamentals-1.html#MARATHONLINES">this code</a>)
	<ul>
  <p>
		<li><a href="output-master.txt">expected output</a>
			You <b>MUST</b> download this file. DO NOT, under any circumstances, copy and paste
			output files from the web browser.</li>
	</ul>
  <p>
<li><a href="../../../../../../docs/StudentHomeworkChecklist-CS120.pdf">Checklist</a>
  <p>
<li><a href="cs120-lab-marathon-sq.pdf">Supplemental Questions</a> This is a document
	that asks you to make changes to the <tt>marathon.c</tt> program and observe the results.
	<b>DO NOT SUBMIT THIS FILE</b>.
  Editable document is <a href="cs120-lab-marathon-sq.odt">here</a>.
	Or, you may find it easier to work with this <a href="supplemental-questions-marathon.txt">
	text version</a> of the PDF file above. This will allow you to copy and paste the
	warnings/errors from the command line instead of having to type everything (incorrectly!)
	by hand.
	<p>
<li>Command line for compiling this lab assignment:
<blockquote><pre>
<big>gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -ansi -pedantic marathon.c -o marathon</big>
</pre></blockquote>

<li>Running your program and capturing the output to a file:
<blockquote><pre>
marathon &gt; output.txt
</pre></blockquote>


<li>Comparing your output with the expected output:
<blockquote><pre>
diff output-master.txt output.txt --strip-trailing-cr
</pre></blockquote>

The <tt>--strip-trailing-cr</tt> option above is usually only needed if you are using Windows.
Mac and Linux systems shouldn't need it. (It doesn't hurt, if you use it, though.)

<!--
<li>Command line for creating a .zip file for submission: (replace <tt><b>YOURLOGIN</b></tt> with your real Digipen login) 
<blockquote><pre>
  <big>zip cs120_<b>YOURLOGIN</b>_1.zip marathon.c 
</pre></blockquote>
Your login is not your numeric
	student ID. It is the name you type when you login to a computer and also your email name. For most freshmen, this is usually
	your first name followed by a period and then your last name (e.g. A student with the name Nigel Tufnel would have a login of <tt>nigel.tufnel</tt>). It may be some variation
	of that as well.
-->	
</ul>		



</ul>

<h2>Other criteria</h2>
<ul>
<li>Before submitting your code, you must include your student information at the top of every 
	file you create. Below is an <b>EXAMPLE</b> of the information that is required for each 
	C file you create. Again, the easiest thing to do is to copy and paste the text
	(including the lines with the asterisks) into your program and <b>modify it</b>. Make sure you
	pay attention to the formatting <i>exactly</i>. Notice how the columns line up and that
	the description is indented 2 spaces under the heading.

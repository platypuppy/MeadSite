<b>Experimenting with the command-line <tt>diff</tt> and visual diff tools:</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Below are several <i>text</i> files for you
	to use. Each pair has a "correct" output and a student's output. Look at each pair of files to see
	if you can spot the differences with your eyes. You'll find that it can be very difficult to
	spot the differences.

<p>
<blockquote>
<a href="output.master1.txt">Correct output #1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="student-output1.txt">Student output #1</a>
<p>
<a href="output.master2.txt">Correct output #2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="student-output2.txt">Student output #2</a>
<p>
<a href="output.master3.txt">Correct output #3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="student-output3.txt">Student output #3</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
All output in one zip file: <a href="alloutput.zip">alloutput.zip</a>
<p>

Then, compare them using the <tt>diff</tt> program, which is part of the Cygwin utilities
on Windows, but is built-in to Linux and Mac.
For example, to compare the first set of files, you would type this at the command prompt:

<big><blockquote><pre>
diff output.master1.txt student-output1.txt
</pre></blockquote></big>

This will display the differences to the screen. If you want to capture the differences in
a file (for later viewing), you need to use <b>output redirection</b> so the output will be placed
into a file like this:

<big><blockquote><pre>
diff output.master1.txt student-output1.txt <b>&gt; differences.txt</b>
</pre></blockquote></big>

The greater-than symbol, <tt><b>&gt;</b></tt>, is the output redirection operator used
by the command window.
<p>
This will place the output in a file called <tt>differences.txt</tt>. You can choose to name
the file anything you like. This is exactly how I can tell if you did your programming assignments
correctly.

<p>
At this point, it's not important that you understand exactly how <tt>diff</tt> works. You should,
however, be able to see where the lines are different. Using Notepad++ (or any text editor),
modify the student output file (add lines, remove lines, change lines) and see how <tt>diff</tt> reacts.
<p>

<big>
Note: You may need to use the <tt>--strip-trailing-cr</tt> option with <tt><b>diff</b></tt> if your
end-of-line characters are different.
</big>

<big><blockquote><pre>
diff <b>--strip-trailing-cr</b> output.master1.txt student-output1.txt &gt; differences.txt 
</pre></blockquote></big>


<blockquote>
<p class="technote">
If you're an advanced student, you may want to learn more about <tt>diff</tt> by reading
<a href="../../../../../../docs/DiffAndPatch.pdf">Comparing and Merging Files with GNU diff and patch</a>,
which contains detailed information about this program. 
<!--<tt><b>diff</b></tt> can be a complex tool, so you might only get through the first 2 chapters.-->
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>After you've seen how <tt>diff</tt> works, compare the files using <tt>WinMerge</tt>. <tt>WinMerge</tt>
is a graphical program for Windows that displays the files side-by-side and highlights the lines that are different.
The program is installed on the computers at Digipen.

<!--
<blockquote>
<p class="technote">
If you can't get WinMerge to work on the computers at Digipen, it's because there may be some configuration
issues. I've talked with IT and they are aware of it and are working on it. Hopefully, it will be
fixed soon.
</blockquote>  
-->

You can download it from the <a href="http://winmerge.org/">WinMerge Website</a> if you'd
like to run it on your own computer.

<p>
Run <tt>WinMergeU</tt> (from the Start menu, choose Run... and type <tt>winmergeu</tt>) and drag and drop 
the two files onto the program.  (The actual name of the executable in Windows is 
<b><tt>WinMergeU.exe</tt></b>. The <b><tt>U</tt></b> means it supports 
<a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/">Unicode</a>.
<a href="http://kunststube.net/encoding/">More</a> 
and <a href="http://www.teknically-speaking.com/2014/02/unicode-utf-8-and-character-encodings_23.html">more</a>.)
Or, you can select two files in Explorer, right-click on one of them and choose <tt>WinMerge</tt>.
It will be obvious where the differences are.
<p>
If you have put WinMerge in your path (the installer will do this automatically for you), 
you could compare them by typing this at the command prompt:

<big><blockquote><pre>
winmergeu output.master1.txt student-output1.txt
</pre></blockquote></big>

Use the "up" and "down" arrows at the top of the program to navigate between differences in the files.
<p>

If you're working on a Mac, you can read about different tools here:
<p>
<blockquote>
<a href="https://www.git-tower.com/blog/diff-tools-mac">Diff Tools on macOS</a>
and
<a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3653/whats-a-good-mac-equivalent-of-winmerge">Mac equivalents of WinMerge</a>
</blockquote>
<p>

If you're working under Linux, there are several similar tools available, such as
<tt>meld</tt>, <tt>kdiff3</tt>, <tt>diffuse</tt> and <tt>kompare</tt> and you should
be able to install them from your distribution's package manager.
<p>
These are all free, cross-platform and should work with Windows, macOS, and Linux:
<p>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://meldmerge.org/">meld</a><br>
<a href="https://sourcegear.com/diffmerge/">diffmerge</a><br>
<a href="https://www.fosshub.com/KDiff3.html">kdiff3</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
Personally, I use <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/">Beyond Compare</a>. It supports Linux,
Mac, and Windows. However, it's not free.
<p class="technote">
If you need help with any of these diff programs, please ask on the 
Miscellaneous Topics forum in Moodle. There may be other students that are more
familiar with other operating systems that can help you.

<b>Please read this entire page before beginning to write code.</b>
<br><br>
Last week, you wrote a function to determine if a given number was a prime number. This week,
you are going to use a different method to create a table (an array) of prime numbers using a technique called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">The Sieve of Erotoshenes</a>.
<br><br>
There are 3 parts to this lab and need to be done in order. Part 1 will require the most
work. Parts 2 and 3 are fairly simple to do after completing the first part.
<br><br>
Part 1 of this lab requires <b>about</b> 10 lines of code.
<br>
Part 2 of this lab requires <b>about</b> 6 lines of code.
<br>
Part 3 of this lab requires <b>about</b> 4 lines of code.
<br><br>
These counts do not include variable declarations, comments, or lines with curly braces.
</p>

  
<hr width="90%">

<ol>
	
<li>Write a function that will find all of the prime numbers between 0 and some number. 
  (By definition, 0 and 1 are not prime, so	you are really searching in the range of 2 to 
  some number. We'll see why we consider 0 and 1 later.) The function will use an array to 
  indicate the prime numbers in the range. For example, this is the list of all prime
	numbers between 2 and 100:
<blockquote><pre>
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
</pre></blockquote>

The method that you will use to find all of the primes in a range is called the 
<i>Sieve of Eratosthenes</i>. The idea is that you start with a list of all numbers in 
the range that you want to find prime numbers. So, if we want to find all of the primes 
between 2 and 100, we'd start with the list:

<blockquote><pre>
<big>2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, . . ., 96, 97, 98, 99, 100</big>
</pre></blockquote>

Starting from 2, you mark 2 as being prime. Then, you cross out all multiples of 2, 
because any number that can be evenly divided by 2 can't be prime. Another way to say
this is that any even number greater than 2 cannot be prime. (<font color="blue">The 
number 4 below has a line through it, but may be difficult to see in the browser.</font>)

<blockquote><pre>
<big><b><font color="red">2</font></b>, 3, <strike><font color="blue"><b>4</b></font></strike>, 5, <strike><font color="blue"><b>6</b></font></strike>, 7, <strike><font color="blue"><b>8</b></font></strike>, 9, <strike><font color="blue"><b>10</b></font></strike>, 11, <strike><font color="blue"><b>12</b></font></strike>, 13, <strike><font color="blue"><b>14</b></font></strike>, 15, . . ., <strike><font color="blue"><b>96</b></font></strike>, 97, <strike><font color="blue"><b>98</b></font></strike>, 99, <strike><font color="blue"><b>100</b></font></strike></big>
</pre></blockquote>

Then, you go to the next number that isn't crossed out and mark that as being prime. 
(That number is 3). Then, you cross out all multiples of 3, because any number that can 
be evenly divided by 3 can't be prime.

<blockquote><pre>
<big><b><font color="red">2</font></b>, <b><font color="red">3</font></b>, <strike>4</strike>, 5, <strike>6</strike>, 7, <strike>8</strike>, <strike><font color="blue"><b>9</b></font></strike>, <strike>10</strike>, 11, <strike>12</strike>, 13, <strike>14</strike>, <strike><font color="blue"><b>15</b></font></strike>, . . ., <strike>96</strike>, 97, <strike>98</strike>, <strike><font color="blue"><b>99</b></font></strike>, <strike>100</strike></big>
</pre></blockquote>

Then, you go to the next number that isn't crossed out and mark that as being prime. 
(That number is 5). Then, you cross out all multiples of 5:

<blockquote><pre>
<big><b><font color="red">2</font></b>, <b><font color="red">3</font></b>, <strike>4</strike>, <b><font color="red">5</font></b>, <strike>6</strike>, 7, <strike>8</strike>, <strike>9</strike>, <strike>10</strike>, 11, <strike>12</strike>, 13, <strike>14</strike>, <strike>15</strike>, . . ., <strike>96</strike>, 97, <strike>98</strike>, <strike>99</strike>, <strike>100</strike></big>
</pre></blockquote>

Those numbers are not shown in the list above, but they would be: 
<tt>25, 35, 55, 65, 85,</tt> and <tt>95</tt>.
<p>
<p class="technote">
<b>Run this animation</b>
<a href="https://www.visnos.com/demos/sieve-of-eratosthenes">here</a>
to see how it works. It uses an array integers 
with values from 1 to N. Start by clicking on "2", then "3", then "5", etc.

<p class="technote">
Here's another <a href="http://www.hbmeyer.de/eratclass.htm">example</a> using an array of 400 integers 
with values from 1 to 400. Start by clicking on "2", then "3", then "5", etc.
<!--
http://www.hbmeyer.de/eratosiv.htm
-->
</p>

<p>
To implement this method, you will use an array that is as large as the range of primes
you wish to find. (Actually, to keep it simple, range + 1 elements because we are going 
to include the range of 0 to <b>N</b>).
<p>
You start by setting all elements to 1, 
indicating that every number in the range is prime. In the example, the number of 
elements in the array is 101 (indexed 0 to 100).
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, . . ., 1, 1, 1, 1
</pre></blockquote>

You can set element 0 and 1 to 0, indicating that the number 0 and the number 1 are 
not prime:

<blockquote><pre>
0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, . . ., 1, 1, 1, 1
</pre></blockquote>

The number 2 is prime, it remains a 1. "Crossing out" (setting to 0) all multiples of 2 
means that all even-numbered indexes will be set to 0:

<blockquote><pre>
0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, . . ., 1, 0, 1, 0
</pre></blockquote>

Continuing with 3 (which is prime) and "crossing out" (setting to 0) multiples of 3:

<blockquote><pre>
0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, . . ., 1, 0, 0, 0
</pre></blockquote>

and so on. <b>You will continue up until, and including, the square root of the maximum number.</b> 
In this case, the number is 100, so we only need to check multiples of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
7, 8, 9, and 10. Technically, we only have to check multiples of 2, 3, 5, and 7. The reason 
is that, since we've already crossed off multiples of 2, 3, and 5, we won't find any 
multiples of 4, 6, 8, 9, or 10. (Those multiples have already been crossed off.) 
<p>
When you are done, the only elements in the array with a value of 1 will correspond to 
prime numbers. So, if the array was named <tt>primes</tt>, these indexes would have the 
value 1:

<blockquote><pre>
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
</pre></blockquote>

In code that means that <tt>primes[2], primes[3], primes[5], primes[7], primes[11], ... 
primes[89],</tt> and <tt>primes[97]</tt> have the value 1.
Every other element has the value 0.
<p>
	
The prototype for the <i>sieve</i> function looks like this:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>void</b> sieve(<b>int</b> array[], <b>int</b> size);
</pre></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>The first parameter is the array that you will modify.</li>
<ul>
  <li>Notice that the first parameter is NOT marked as <tt><b>const</b></tt>, meaning 
  you will be changing it.</li>
</ul>

<li>The second parameter is the size (number of elements) of the array. 
Hints:
<ul>
<li>You need to set all of the values in <tt>array</tt> to TRUE before starting the loop.
<li>You will have a nested loop.
<li>Use the values TRUE and FALSE in your code. <b>DO NOT</b> use 1 and 0.
</ul>
<li>It is expected that you will set some of the array elements to FALSE multiple times. For example, when
  crossing out multiples of 2, you will set index 10 to FALSE. You will also set index 10
  to FALSE when crossing out multiples of 5. This is expected and is the correct way to
  do it. <b>DO NOT TRY TO AVOID THAT.</b> You
  will most certainly have more complex logic, more errors in your code, and a slower program
  if you try to avoid it.
</ul>
<p>
Finally, <b>think before you start</b> to type anything. This is a simple task, if you think
before starting. <b>The solution requires about 10 lines of code (more or less) not counting 
comments, white space, or braces.</b> You are not being graded on the number of lines you
write, but if you find that you have more than 20 lines and are having trouble, you
need to ask for help.

<li>A twin prime is a prime number that differs from another prime number by two. For 
  example, here are some twin primes:
	
<blockquote><pre>
	 3 and  5
	 5 and  7
	11 and 13
	17 and 19
	59 and 61
	71 and 73
</pre></blockquote>
	
Like primes, there are an infinite number of twin primes. Using the array that you 
created	in the first part of the lab, print out all of the twin primes in a range. The 
prototype looks like this:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>int</b> twin_primes(<b>const</b> <b>int</b> primes[], <b>int</b> size);
</pre></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>The first parameter is the array that you created in the <i>sieve</i> function.</li>
<ul>
  <li>Notice that the first parameter is marked as <tt><b>const</b></tt>, meaning 
  you are not changing it at all.</li>
</ul>

<li>The second parameter is the size (number of elements) of the array. 
<li>To find the twin primes, you simply have to walk through the array (starting at 3) looking for a pair 
and when you find a pair, print them out. The printf format is: 
<tt>"twin prime #%4i: %4i and %4i\n"</tt>
<li>The return value is the number of twin primes (pairs) that you found.
<li>Be careful not to go past the end of the array. Your program will be <i>undefined</i>
  if you do, which could mean it crashes, or, sadly, produces the correct output. This
  means it may <i>appear</i> to run correctly on your computer, but when you upload
  it to the submission server, it may crash and you won't get any credit. If that's
  the case, you will definitely want to ask for help.
</ul>
<p>
Again, think before you start. <b>A solution for this will need about 6 lines of
code (not counting comments, white space, or braces).</b> You aren't being graded on how 
many lines of code you have, but if you have over 12, you need to stop and ask for help.

<li>The sum of the reciprocals of all of the twin primes is known

Using the array that you created in the first part of the lab, calculate Brun's Constant. 
The prototype looks like this:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>double</b> brun_constant(<b>const</b> <b>int</b> primes[], <b>int</b> size);
</pre></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>The first parameter is the array that you created in the <i>sieve</i> function.</li>
<ul>
    <li>Notice that the first parameter is marked as <tt><b>const</b></tt>, meaning 
  you are not changing it at all.</li>
</ul>
<li>The second parameter is the size (number of elements) of the array.</li>
<li>The return value is the value that you calculated in the function. The precision of 
  the number will depend on how many twin primes were used in your calculation.</li>
</ul>	
<p>
If you've completed the <i>twin_primes</i> function, then calculating Brun's Constant is 
very simple.
<p>
	
Here are some values produced when running the program with arrays of different sizes. (The
actual prime numbers and twin primes have been left out to keep it readable.)

<blockquote><pre>
25 primes found between 0 and 100.
8 twin primes found between 0 and 100.
Brun's constant with 8 twin primes is 1.330990365719.

168 primes found between 0 and 1000.
35 twin primes found between 0 and 1000.

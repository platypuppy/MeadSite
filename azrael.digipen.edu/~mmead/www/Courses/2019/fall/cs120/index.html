There are many people that can answer your question. If you

if you have a question about the assignment, it's very likely that many other students have the same

<br><br>
There are now two Supplementary Review Lectures for CS120 this semester. There is one on Friday
afternoons from 4:00 to 5:00 pm in Michelangelo. There is another on Monday afternoons from
5:00 to 6:00 pm in Van Gogh. Both lectures will review what was covered during the week (or
previous weeks) in CS120. They are optional, but highly recommended, especially for students
that are new to programming or are having difficulty keeping up with the information.

Required Software (free)
</p>
	
All of the software that is required for this course is installed on all of the computers at Digipen.
However, for those of you that wish to also work on your own computers (recommended), these are the
things you will need to install and configure on your own computer.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Windows 64-bit C compiler (MinGW)</b> This is the compiler that we will be using for all of the
	work in CS120. There are detailed instructions on downloading, installing, and configuring
	the software <a href="../../../../public/mingw/index.html">here</a>.
	Note that this will also install a C++ compiler, which you will need next semester in CS170.
<p>


<li><b>Cygwin Utilities</b> - Download the <a href="https://azrael.digipen.edu/~mmead/www/public/Files/preinstalls/cygwin64-2016-preinstalled.zip">Cygwin64 programs</a> 
and put them on your computer. There's a document 
<a class="pdf-icon" href="../../../../public/Files/preinstalls/readme-2017-cygwin-install.pdf">readme-2017-cygwin-install.pdf</a>
that explains what to do.
<p class="technote">
The zip file contains many command-line utilities that you will use throughout your time at Digipen.
The zip file is about 530 MB and extracts to about 1.5 GB.
Creates a folder named <tt>cygwin64</tt> on the C: drive.
</p>
<!--
 There is also a PDF there that explains what to do: 
<a href="http://azrael.digipen.edu/~mmead/www/public/Files/preinstalls/readme-2014-RTIS-image.pdf">readme-2014-RTIS-image.pdf</a>.
<p class="technote">
Note that you only need the Cygwin64 files. You don't need any of the other files (e.g. Clang, MinGW, etc.) that are posted on
that site. You're welcome to download them and try them, but I won't give you any support on those. You will need 
some of those programs in CS170 next semester.
-->
</li>
Don't forget to add <tt>C:\cygwin64\bin</tt> directory to your PATH. 
<!--
	<a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/renso/archive/2009/10/21/how-to-set-the-windows-path-in-windows-7.aspx">
	Windows 7</a>. -->
	 If you're new to computers or Windows, there's a nicer GUI (Graphical User Interface) program
	called <a href="http://eveditor.com">Windows Environment Variables Editor</a> that makes it easier to
	manipulate the PATH.</li>

<ul>
	<li>Understanding the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)">PATH variable</a> from wikipedia.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access/">
		Editing the PATH variable</a> on Windows 7, 8, and 10.</li>
	<li>Once you've got Cygwin installed in Windows and in your PATH, you can type this to see a better view of
		your PATH from the command line:
<blockquote><pre>path | tr ; "\n"</pre></blockquote>
		This will list all of the directories in the PATH with each on a separate line. That is:
<blockquote>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 border=1>
<tr><th>Token</th><th>Meaning</th><tr>
<tr><td align="center"><tt>path</tt></td><td>Displays the PATH as one long line</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"><tt>|</tt></td><td>A vertical bar (pipe symbol), usually on the key with the backslash (\)</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"><tt>tr</tt></td><td>The translate command</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"><tt>;</tt></td><td>A semi-colon (usually to the right of the letter 'L' on the keyboard). On Linux and 
Mac OS X, use a colon <big><b>:</b></big> instead.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"><tt>"\n"</tt></td><td>A double quote, backslash, lowercase letter 'N', double quote</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

</ul>
<li><b>C compiler for non-Windows users:</b>
<p class="technote">
Version 8.1.0 is what is installed with MinGW on the computers at Digipen.
For non-Windows users, if you can't get version 8.1.0,  
any 8.x.x version will probably be fine. We won't be using any of the advanced features of 
C that are in 8.x, but you do want to have the closest version possible so that you will 
get the same errors and warnings that 8.1 emits. 
<br><br>
For Mac people, you may have to install it (using <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a>)
 as the default compiler for C and C++ on Mac is Clang. If you are new to software development,
 you may need to seek help from other Mac users. (I'm not a Mac user, although I pretend sometimes!)
<!--
For Mac people, you can follow this link to 
<a href="../../../../mg/compiling-gcc7/index.html">building GCC 7.1 on macOS</a>.
I've only tested this with macOS 10.11 (El Capitan). You can also use this link to install
on Linux, but it is easier to use the link below.
-->

<br><br>
For Linux people, I recommend Linux Mint. The latest version comes with version 7.x, but
it can easily be upgraded. 
Here's some information on 
<a href="../../../../mg/update-compilers/index.html#UPDATE2">installing multiple versions</a>.
<!--
-->

 However, any distribution that allows you
to use version 8.x of the compiler should work.
<br><br>
Note that these installations will also install a C++ compiler, which you will need next semester in CS170.

	The Perils Of Java Schools</a> This is why Digipen grads are sought after by many

If you want an "easy" CS degree, go somewhere else. There are plenty of
schools to choose from. Here's another <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/12/11/back-to-basics/">
good article</a> from Joel that maybe should help you appreciate why we do it this way. The second article
is a little advanced in some places, but you should be able to follow the ideas. The articles are
